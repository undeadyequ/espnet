l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-01 THE PATCHWORK GIRL OF OZ BY L. FRANK BAUM AFFECTIONATELY DEDICATED TO MY YOUNG FRIEND SUMNER HAMILTON BRITTON OF CHICAGO PROLOGUE THROUGH THE KINDNESS OF DOROTHY GALE OF KANSAS AFTERWARD PRINCESS DOROTHY OF OZ AN HUMBLE WRITER IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WAS ONCE APPOINTED ROYAL HISTORIAN OF OZ WITH THE PRIVILEGE OF WRITING THE CHRONICLE OF THAT WONDERFUL FAIRYLAND.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-02 BUT AFTER MAKING SIX BOOKS ABOUT THE ADVENTURES OF THOSE INTERESTING BUT QUEER PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THE LAND OF OZ THE HISTORIAN LEARNED WITH SORROW THAT BY AN EDICT OF THE SUPREME RULER OZMA OF OZ HER COUNTRY WOULD THEREAFTER BE RENDERED INVISIBLE TO ALL WHO LIVED OUTSIDE ITS BORDERS AND THAT ALL COMMUNICATION WITH OZ WOULD IN THE FUTURE BE CUT OFF.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-03 THE CHILDREN WHO HAD LEARNED TO LOOK FOR THE BOOKS ABOUT OZ AND WHO LOVED THE STORIES ABOUT THE GAY AND HAPPY PEOPLE INHABITING THAT FAVORED COUNTRY WERE AS SORRY AS THEIR HISTORIAN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE BOOKS OF OZ STORIES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-04 THEY WROTE MANY LETTERS ASKING IF THE HISTORIAN DID NOT KNOW OF SOME ADVENTURES TO WRITE ABOUT THAT HAD HAPPENED BEFORE THE LAND OF OZ WAS SHUT OUT FROM ALL THE REST OF THE WORLD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-05 BUT HE DID NOT KNOW OF ANY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-06 FINALLY ONE OF THE CHILDREN INQUIRED WHY WE COULDN'T HEAR FROM PRINCESS DOROTHY BY WIRELESS TELEGRAPH WHICH WOULD ENABLE HER TO COMMUNICATE TO THE HISTORIAN WHATEVER HAPPENED IN THE FAR OFF LAND OF OZ WITHOUT HIS SEEING HER OR EVEN KNOWING JUST WHERE OZ IS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-07 THAT SEEMED A GOOD IDEA,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-08 SO THE HISTORIAN RIGGED UP A HIGH TOWER IN HIS BACK YARD AND TOOK LESSONS IN WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY UNTIL HE UNDERSTOOD IT AND THEN BEGAN TO CALL PRINCESS DOROTHY OF OZ BY SENDING MESSAGES INTO THE AIR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-09 NOW IT WASN'T LIKELY THAT DOROTHY WOULD BE LOOKING FOR WIRELESS MESSAGES OR WOULD HEED THE CALL,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-10 BUT ONE THING THE HISTORIAN WAS SURE OF AND THAT WAS THAT THE POWERFUL SORCERESS GLINDA WOULD KNOW WHAT HE WAS DOING AND THAT HE DESIRED TO COMMUNICATE WITH DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-11 FOR GLINDA HAS A BIG BOOK IN WHICH IS RECORDED EVERY EVENT THAT TAKES PLACE ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD JUST THE MOMENT THAT IT HAPPENS AND SO OF COURSE THE BOOK WOULD TELL HER ABOUT THE WIRELESS MESSAGE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-12 AND THAT WAS THE WAY DOROTHY HEARD THAT THE HISTORIAN WANTED TO SPEAK WITH HER AND THERE WAS A SHAGGY MAN IN THE LAND OF OZ WHO KNEW HOW TO TELEGRAPH A WIRELESS REPLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-13 THE RESULT WAS THAT THE HISTORIAN BEGGED SO HARD TO BE TOLD THE LATEST NEWS OF OZ SO THAT HE COULD WRITE IT DOWN FOR THE CHILDREN TO READ THAT DOROTHY ASKED PERMISSION OF OZMA AND OZMA GRACIOUSLY CONSENTED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-14 THAT IS WHY AFTER TWO LONG YEARS OF WAITING ANOTHER OZ STORY IS NOW PRESENTED TO THE CHILDREN OF AMERICA.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-15 THIS WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE HAD NOT SOME CLEVER MAN INVENTED THE WIRELESS AND AN EQUALLY CLEVER CHILD SUGGESTED THE IDEA OF REACHING THE MYSTERIOUS LAND OF OZ BY ITS MEANS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-16 L. FRANK BAUM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-17 OZCOT AT HOLLYWOOD IN CALIFORNIA THE PATCHWORK GIRL OF OZ CHAPTER ONE OJO AND UNC NUNKIE WHERE'S THE BUTTER UNC NUNKIE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-18 ASKED OJO. UNC LOOKED OUT OF THE WINDOW AND STROKED HIS LONG BEARD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-19 THEN HE TURNED TO THE MUNCHKIN BOY AND SHOOK HIS HEAD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-20 ISN'T SAID HE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-21 ISN'T ANY BUTTER?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-22 THAT'S TOO BAD UNC. WHERE'S THE JAM THEN?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-23 INQUIRED OJO STANDING ON A STOOL SO HE COULD LOOK THROUGH ALL THE SHELVES OF THE CUPBOARD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-24 BUT UNC NUNKIE SHOOK HIS HEAD AGAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-25 GONE HE SAID.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-26 NO JAM EITHER?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-27 AND NO CAKE NO JELLY NO APPLES NOTHING BUT BREAD?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-28 ALL SAID UNC AGAIN STROKING HIS BEARD AS HE GAZED FROM THE WINDOW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-29 THE LITTLE BOY BROUGHT THE STOOL AND SAT BESIDE HIS UNCLE MUNCHING THE DRY BREAD SLOWLY AND SEEMING IN DEEP THOUGHT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-30 NOTHING GROWS IN OUR YARD BUT THE BREAD TREE HE MUSED AND THERE ARE ONLY TWO MORE LOAVES ON THAT TREE,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-31 AND THEY'RE NOT RIPE YET.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-32 TELL ME UNC,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-33 WHY ARE WE SO POOR?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-34 THE OLD MUNCHKIN TURNED AND LOOKED AT OJO. HE HAD KINDLY EYES BUT HE HADN'T SMILED OR LAUGHED IN SO LONG THAT THE BOY HAD FORGOTTEN THAT UNC NUNKIE COULD LOOK ANY OTHER WAY THAN SOLEMN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-35 AND UNC NEVER SPOKE ANY MORE WORDS THAN HE WAS OBLIGED TO SO HIS LITTLE NEPHEW WHO LIVED ALONE WITH HIM HAD LEARNED TO UNDERSTAND A GREAT DEAL FROM ONE WORD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-36 WHY ARE WE SO POOR UNC?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-37 REPEATED THE BOY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-38 NOT SAID THE OLD MUNCHKIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-39 I THINK WE ARE DECLARED OJO. WHAT HAVE WE GOT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-40 I KNOW,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-41 BUT EVERYONE IN THE LAND OF OZ HAS A PLACE TO LIVE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-42 WHAT ELSE UNC?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-43 BREAD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-44 I'M EATING THE LAST LOAF THAT'S RIPE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-45 THERE,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-46 I'VE PUT ASIDE YOUR SHARE UNC. IT'S ON THE TABLE SO YOU CAN EAT IT WHEN YOU GET HUNGRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-47 BUT WHEN THAT IS GONE WHAT SHALL WE EAT UNC?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-48 THE OLD MAN SHIFTED IN HIS CHAIR BUT MERELY SHOOK HIS HEAD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-49 OF COURSE SAID OJO WHO WAS OBLIGED TO TALK BECAUSE HIS UNCLE WOULD NOT NO ONE STARVES IN THE LAND OF OZ EITHER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-50 THERE IS PLENTY FOR EVERYONE YOU KNOW,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-51 ONLY IF IT ISN'T JUST WHERE YOU HAPPEN TO BE YOU MUST GO WHERE IT IS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-52 THE AGED MUNCHKIN WRIGGLED AGAIN AND STARED AT HIS SMALL NEPHEW AS IF DISTURBED BY HIS ARGUMENT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-53 BY TO MORROW MORNING THE BOY WENT ON WE MUST GO WHERE THERE IS SOMETHING TO EAT OR WE SHALL GROW VERY HUNGRY AND BECOME VERY UNHAPPY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-54 WHERE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-55 ASKED UNC. WHERE SHALL WE GO?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-56 I DON'T KNOW I'M SURE REPLIED OJO. BUT YOU MUST KNOW UNC. YOU MUST HAVE TRAVELED IN YOUR TIME BECAUSE YOU'RE SO OLD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-57 I DON'T REMEMBER IT BECAUSE EVER SINCE I COULD REMEMBER ANYTHING WE'VE LIVED RIGHT HERE IN THIS LONESOME ROUND HOUSE WITH A LITTLE GARDEN BACK OF IT AND THE THICK WOODS ALL AROUND.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-58 ALL I'VE EVER SEEN OF THE GREAT LAND OF OZ UNC DEAR IS THE VIEW OF THAT MOUNTAIN OVER AT THE SOUTH WHERE THEY SAY THE HAMMERHEADS LIVE WHO WON'T LET ANYBODY GO BY THEM AND THAT MOUNTAIN AT THE NORTH WHERE THEY SAY NOBODY LIVES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-59 ONE DECLARED UNC CORRECTING HIM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-60 OH YES,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-61 ONE FAMILY LIVES THERE I'VE HEARD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-62 THAT'S THE CROOKED MAGICIAN WHO IS NAMED DOCTOR PIPT AND HIS WIFE MARGOLOTTE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-63 ONE YEAR YOU TOLD ME ABOUT THEM,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-64 I THINK IT TOOK YOU A WHOLE YEAR UNC TO SAY AS MUCH AS I'VE JUST SAID ABOUT THE CROOKED MAGICIAN AND HIS WIFE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-65 THEY LIVE HIGH UP ON THE MOUNTAIN AND THE GOOD MUNCHKIN COUNTRY WHERE THE FRUITS AND FLOWERS GROW IS JUST THE OTHER SIDE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-66 IT'S FUNNY YOU AND I SHOULD LIVE HERE ALL ALONE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FOREST ISN'T IT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-67 YES SAID UNC. THEN LET'S GO AWAY AND VISIT THE MUNCHKIN COUNTRY AND ITS JOLLY GOOD NATURED PEOPLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-68 I'D LOVE TO GET A SIGHT OF SOMETHING BESIDES WOODS UNC NUNKIE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-69 TOO LITTLE SAID UNC. WHY I'M NOT SO LITTLE AS I USED TO BE ANSWERED THE BOY EARNESTLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-70 I THINK I CAN WALK AS FAR AND AS FAST THROUGH THE WOODS AS YOU CAN UNC. AND NOW THAT NOTHING GROWS IN OUR BACK YARD THAT IS GOOD TO EAT WE MUST GO WHERE THERE IS FOOD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-71 UNC NUNKIE MADE NO REPLY FOR A TIME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-72 THEN HE SHUT DOWN THE WINDOW AND TURNED HIS CHAIR TO FACE THE ROOM FOR THE SUN WAS SINKING BEHIND THE TREE TOPS AND IT WAS GROWING COOL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-73 BY AND BY OJO LIGHTED THE FIRE AND THE LOGS BLAZED FREELY IN THE BROAD FIREPLACE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-74 THE TWO SAT IN THE FIRELIGHT A LONG TIME THE OLD WHITE BEARDED MUNCHKIN AND THE LITTLE BOY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-75 BOTH WERE THINKING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-76 WHEN IT GREW QUITE DARK OUTSIDE OJO SAID, EAT YOUR BREAD UNC AND THEN WE WILL GO TO BED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-77 BUT UNC NUNKIE DID NOT EAT THE BREAD,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-78 NEITHER DID HE GO DIRECTLY TO BED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-01-79 LONG AFTER HIS LITTLE NEPHEW WAS SOUND ASLEEP IN THE CORNER OF THE ROOM THE OLD MAN SAT BY THE FIRE THINKING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-01 CHAPTER TWO THE CROOKED MAGICIAN JUST AT DAWN NEXT MORNING UNC NUNKIE LAID HIS HAND TENDERLY ON OJO'S HEAD AND AWAKENED HIM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-02 COME HE SAID.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-03 OJO DRESSED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-04 HE WORE BLUE SILK STOCKINGS BLUE KNEE PANTS WITH GOLD BUCKLES A BLUE RUFFLED WAIST AND A JACKET OF BRIGHT BLUE BRAIDED WITH GOLD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-05 HIS SHOES WERE OF BLUE LEATHER AND TURNED UP AT THE TOES WHICH WERE POINTED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-06 HIS HAT HAD A PEAKED CROWN AND A FLAT BRIM AND AROUND THE BRIM WAS A ROW OF TINY GOLDEN BELLS THAT TINKLED WHEN HE MOVED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-07 THIS WAS THE NATIVE COSTUME OF THOSE WHO INHABITED THE MUNCHKIN COUNTRY OF THE LAND OF OZ SO UNC NUNKIE'S DRESS WAS MUCH LIKE THAT OF HIS NEPHEW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-08 INSTEAD OF SHOES THE OLD MAN WORE BOOTS WITH TURNOVER TOPS AND HIS BLUE COAT HAD WIDE CUFFS OF GOLD BRAID.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-09 THE BOY NOTICED THAT HIS UNCLE HAD NOT EATEN THE BREAD AND SUPPOSED THE OLD MAN HAD NOT BEEN HUNGRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-10 OJO WAS HUNGRY THOUGH,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-11 SO HE DIVIDED THE PIECE OF BREAD UPON THE TABLE AND ATE HIS HALF FOR BREAKFAST WASHING IT DOWN WITH FRESH COOL WATER FROM THE BROOK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-12 UNC PUT THE OTHER PIECE OF BREAD IN HIS JACKET POCKET AFTER WHICH HE AGAIN SAID AS HE WALKED OUT THROUGH THE DOORWAY, COME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-13 OJO WAS WELL PLEASED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-14 HE WAS DREADFULLY TIRED OF LIVING ALL ALONE IN THE WOODS AND WANTED TO TRAVEL AND SEE PEOPLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-15 FOR A LONG TIME HE HAD WISHED TO EXPLORE THE BEAUTIFUL LAND OF OZ IN WHICH THEY LIVED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-16 WHEN THEY WERE OUTSIDE UNC SIMPLY LATCHED THE DOOR AND STARTED UP THE PATH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-17 NO ONE WOULD DISTURB THEIR LITTLE HOUSE EVEN IF ANYONE CAME SO FAR INTO THE THICK FOREST WHILE THEY WERE GONE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-18 AT THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAIN THAT SEPARATED THE COUNTRY OF THE MUNCHKINS FROM THE COUNTRY OF THE GILLIKINS THE PATH DIVIDED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-19 ONE WAY LED TO THE LEFT AND THE OTHER TO THE RIGHT STRAIGHT UP THE MOUNTAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-20 UNC NUNKIE TOOK THIS RIGHT HAND PATH AND OJO FOLLOWED WITHOUT ASKING WHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-21 HE KNEW IT WOULD TAKE THEM TO THE HOUSE OF THE CROOKED MAGICIAN WHOM HE HAD NEVER SEEN BUT WHO WAS THEIR NEAREST NEIGHBOR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-22 ALL THE MORNING THEY TRUDGED UP THE MOUNTAIN PATH AND AT NOON UNC AND OJO SAT ON A FALLEN TREE TRUNK AND ATE THE LAST OF THE BREAD WHICH THE OLD MUNCHKIN HAD PLACED IN HIS POCKET.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-23 THEN THEY STARTED ON AGAIN AND TWO HOURS LATER CAME IN SIGHT OF THE HOUSE OF DOCTOR PIPT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-24 IT WAS A BIG HOUSE ROUND AS WERE ALL THE MUNCHKIN HOUSES AND PAINTED BLUE WHICH IS THE DISTINCTIVE COLOR OF THE MUNCHKIN COUNTRY OF OZ. THERE WAS A PRETTY GARDEN AROUND THE HOUSE WHERE BLUE TREES AND BLUE FLOWERS GREW IN ABUNDANCE AND IN ONE PLACE WERE BEDS OF BLUE CABBAGES BLUE CARROTS AND BLUE LETTUCE ALL OF WHICH WERE DELICIOUS TO EAT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-25 IN DOCTOR PIPT'S GARDEN GREW BUN TREES CAKE TREES CREAM PUFF BUSHES BLUE BUTTERCUPS WHICH YIELDED EXCELLENT BLUE BUTTER AND A ROW OF CHOCOLATE CARAMEL PLANTS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-26 PATHS OF BLUE GRAVEL DIVIDED THE VEGETABLE AND FLOWER BEDS AND A WIDER PATH LED UP TO THE FRONT DOOR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-27 THE PLACE WAS IN A CLEARING ON THE MOUNTAIN BUT A LITTLE WAY OFF WAS THE GRIM FOREST WHICH COMPLETELY SURROUNDED IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-28 UNC KNOCKED AT THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE AND A CHUBBY PLEASANT FACED WOMAN DRESSED ALL IN BLUE OPENED IT AND GREETED THE VISITORS WITH A SMILE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-29 AH SAID OJO,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-30 YOU MUST BE DAME MARGOLOTTE THE GOOD WIFE OF DOCTOR PIPT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-31 I AM MY DEAR AND ALL STRANGERS ARE WELCOME TO MY HOME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-32 MAY WE SEE THE FAMOUS MAGICIAN MADAM?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-33 HE IS VERY BUSY JUST NOW SHE SAID SHAKING HER HEAD DOUBTFULLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-34 BUT COME IN AND LET ME GIVE YOU SOMETHING TO EAT FOR YOU MUST HAVE TRAVELED FAR IN ORDER TO GET OUR LONELY PLACE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-35 WE HAVE REPLIED OJO AS HE AND UNC ENTERED THE HOUSE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-36 WE HAVE COME FROM A FAR LONELIER PLACE THAN THIS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-37 PLACE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-38 AND IN THE MUNCHKIN COUNTRY?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-39 SHE EXCLAIMED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-40 THEN IT MUST BE SOMEWHERE IN THE BLUE FOREST.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-41 IT IS GOOD DAME MARGOLOTTE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-42 DEAR ME!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-43 SHE SAID LOOKING AT THE MAN YOU MUST BE UNC NUNKIE KNOWN AS THE SILENT ONE. THEN SHE LOOKED AT THE BOY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-44 AND YOU MUST BE OJO THE UNLUCKY SHE ADDED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-45 YES SAID UNC. I NEVER KNEW I WAS CALLED THE UNLUCKY SAID OJO SOBERLY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-46 BUT IT IS REALLY A GOOD NAME FOR ME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-47 WELL REMARKED THE WOMAN AS SHE BUSTLED AROUND THE ROOM AND SET THE TABLE AND BROUGHT FOOD FROM THE CUPBOARD YOU WERE UNLUCKY TO LIVE ALL ALONE IN THAT DISMAL FOREST WHICH IS MUCH WORSE THAN THE FOREST AROUND HERE,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-48 BUT PERHAPS YOUR LUCK WILL CHANGE NOW YOU ARE AWAY FROM IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-49 IF DURING YOUR TRAVELS YOU CAN MANAGE TO LOSE THAT UN AT THE BEGINNING OF YOUR NAME UNLUCKY YOU WILL THEN BECOME OJO THE LUCKY WHICH WILL BE A GREAT IMPROVEMENT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-50 HOW CAN I LOSE THAT UN DAME MARGOLOTTE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-51 I DO NOT KNOW HOW BUT YOU MUST KEEP THE MATTER IN MIND AND PERHAPS THE CHANCE WILL COME TO YOU SHE REPLIED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-52 OJO HAD NEVER EATEN SUCH A FINE MEAL IN ALL HIS LIFE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-53 THERE WAS A SAVORY STEW SMOKING HOT A DISH OF BLUE PEAS A BOWL OF SWEET MILK OF A DELICATE BLUE TINT AND A BLUE PUDDING WITH BLUE PLUMS IN IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-54 WHEN THE VISITORS HAD EATEN HEARTILY OF THIS FARE THE WOMAN SAID TO THEM, DO YOU WISH TO SEE DOCTOR PIPT ON BUSINESS OR FOR PLEASURE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-55 UNC SHOOK HIS HEAD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-56 WE ARE TRAVELING REPLIED OJO AND WE STOPPED AT YOUR HOUSE JUST TO REST AND REFRESH OURSELVES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-57 I DO NOT THINK UNC NUNKIE CARES VERY MUCH TO SEE THE FAMOUS CROOKED MAGICIAN,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-58 BUT FOR MY PART I AM CURIOUS TO LOOK AT SUCH A GREAT MAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-59 THE WOMAN SEEMED THOUGHTFUL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-60 I REMEMBER THAT UNC NUNKIE AND MY HUSBAND USED TO BE FRIENDS MANY YEARS AGO SHE SAID SO PERHAPS THEY WILL BE GLAD TO MEET AGAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-61 THE MAGICIAN IS VERY BUSY AS I SAID BUT IF YOU WILL PROMISE NOT TO DISTURB HIM YOU MAY COME INTO HIS WORKSHOP AND WATCH HIM PREPARE A WONDERFUL CHARM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-62 THANK YOU REPLIED THE BOY MUCH PLEASED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-63 I WOULD LIKE TO DO THAT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-64 SHE LED THE WAY TO A GREAT DOMED HALL AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE WHICH WAS THE MAGICIAN'S WORKSHOP.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-65 THERE WAS A ROW OF WINDOWS EXTENDING NEARLY AROUND THE SIDES OF THE CIRCULAR ROOM WHICH RENDERED THE PLACE VERY LIGHT AND THERE WAS A BACK DOOR IN ADDITION TO THE ONE LEADING TO THE FRONT PART OF THE HOUSE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-66 BEFORE THE ROW OF WINDOWS A BROAD SEAT WAS BUILT AND THERE WERE SOME CHAIRS AND BENCHES IN THE ROOM BESIDES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-67 AT ONE END STOOD A GREAT FIREPLACE IN WHICH A BLUE LOG WAS BLAZING WITH A BLUE FLAME AND OVER THE FIRE HUNG FOUR KETTLES IN A ROW ALL BUBBLING AND STEAMING AT A GREAT RATE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-68 THE MAGICIAN WAS STIRRING ALL FOUR OF THESE KETTLES AT THE SAME TIME TWO WITH HIS HANDS AND TWO WITH HIS FEET TO THE LATTER WOODEN LADLES BEING STRAPPED FOR THIS MAN WAS SO VERY CROOKED THAT HIS LEGS WERE AS HANDY AS HIS ARMS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-69 UNC NUNKIE CAME FORWARD TO GREET HIS OLD FRIEND BUT NOT BEING ABLE TO SHAKE EITHER HIS HANDS OR HIS FEET WHICH WERE ALL OCCUPIED IN STIRRING HE PATTED THE MAGICIAN'S BALD HEAD AND ASKED, WHAT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-70 AH IT'S THE SILENT ONE REMARKED DOCTOR PIPT WITHOUT LOOKING UP AND HE WANTS TO KNOW WHAT I'M MAKING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-71 WELL WHEN IT IS QUITE FINISHED THIS COMPOUND WILL BE THE WONDERFUL POWDER OF LIFE WHICH NO ONE KNOWS HOW TO MAKE BUT MYSELF.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-72 WHENEVER IT IS SPRINKLED ON ANYTHING THAT THING WILL AT ONCE COME TO LIFE NO MATTER WHAT IT IS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-73 IT TAKES ME SEVERAL YEARS TO MAKE THIS MAGIC POWDER BUT AT THIS MOMENT I AM PLEASED TO SAY IT IS NEARLY DONE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-74 YOU SEE I AM MAKING IT FOR MY GOOD WIFE MARGOLOTTE WHO WANTS TO USE SOME OF IT FOR A PURPOSE OF HER OWN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-75 YOU MUST KNOW SAID MARGOLOTTE WHEN THEY WERE ALL SEATED TOGETHER ON THE BROAD WINDOW SEAT THAT MY HUSBAND FOOLISHLY GAVE AWAY ALL THE POWDER OF LIFE HE FIRST MADE TO OLD MOMBI THE WITCH WHO USED TO LIVE IN THE COUNTRY OF THE GILLIKINS TO THE NORTH OF HERE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-76 MOMBI GAVE TO DOCTOR PIPT A POWDER OF PERPETUAL YOUTH IN EXCHANGE FOR HIS POWDER OF LIFE BUT SHE CHEATED HIM WICKEDLY FOR THE POWDER OF YOUTH WAS NO GOOD AND COULD WORK NO MAGIC AT ALL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-77 PERHAPS THE POWDER OF LIFE COULDN'T EITHER SAID OJO. YES,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-78 IT IS PERFECTION SHE DECLARED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-79 THE FIRST LOT WE TESTED ON OUR GLASS CAT WHICH NOT ONLY BEGAN TO LIVE BUT HAS LIVED EVER SINCE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-80 SHE'S SOMEWHERE AROUND THE HOUSE NOW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-81 A GLASS CAT!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-82 EXCLAIMED OJO ASTONISHED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-83 YES,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-84 SHE MAKES A VERY PLEASANT COMPANION BUT ADMIRES HERSELF A LITTLE MORE THAN IS CONSIDERED MODEST AND SHE POSITIVELY REFUSES TO CATCH MICE EXPLAINED MARGOLOTTE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-85 MY HUSBAND MADE THE CAT SOME PINK BRAINS BUT THEY PROVED TO BE TOO HIGH BRED AND PARTICULAR FOR A CAT SO SHE THINKS IT IS UNDIGNIFIED IN HER TO CATCH MICE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-86 ALSO SHE HAS A PRETTY BLOOD RED HEART BUT IT IS MADE OF STONE A RUBY I THINK AND SO IS RATHER HARD AND UNFEELING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-87 I THINK THE NEXT GLASS CAT THE MAGICIAN MAKES WILL HAVE NEITHER BRAINS NOR HEART FOR THEN IT WILL NOT OBJECT TO CATCHING MICE AND MAY PROVE OF SOME USE TO US.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-88 WHAT DID OLD MOMBI THE WITCH DO WITH THE POWDER OF LIFE YOUR HUSBAND GAVE HER?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-89 ASKED THE BOY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-90 SHE BROUGHT JACK PUMPKINHEAD TO LIFE FOR ONE THING WAS THE REPLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-91 I SUPPOSE YOU'VE HEARD OF JACK PUMPKINHEAD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-92 HE IS NOW LIVING NEAR THE EMERALD CITY AND IS A GREAT FAVORITE WITH THE PRINCESS OZMA WHO RULES ALL THE LAND OF OZ. NO,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-93 I'VE NEVER HEARD OF HIM REMARKED OJO. I'M AFRAID I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE LAND OF OZ. YOU SEE I'VE LIVED ALL MY LIFE WITH UNC NUNKIE THE SILENT ONE AND THERE WAS NO ONE TO TELL ME ANYTHING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-94 THAT IS ONE REASON YOU ARE OJO THE UNLUCKY SAID THE WOMAN IN A SYMPATHETIC TONE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-95 THE MORE ONE KNOWS THE LUCKIER HE IS FOR KNOWLEDGE IS THE GREATEST GIFT IN LIFE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-96 BUT TELL ME PLEASE WHAT YOU INTEND TO DO WITH THIS NEW LOT OF THE POWDER OF LIFE WHICH DOCTOR PIPT IS MAKING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-97 HE SAID HIS WIFE WANTED IT FOR SOME ESPECIAL PURPOSE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-98 SO I DO SHE ANSWERED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-99 I WANT IT TO BRING MY PATCHWORK GIRL TO LIFE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-100 OH!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-101 A PATCHWORK GIRL?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-102 WHAT IS THAT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-103 OJO ASKED FOR THIS SEEMED EVEN MORE STRANGE AND UNUSUAL THAN A GLASS CAT. I THINK I MUST SHOW YOU MY PATCHWORK GIRL SAID MARGOLOTTE LAUGHING AT THE BOY'S ASTONISHMENT FOR SHE IS RATHER DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-104 BUT FIRST I WILL TELL YOU THAT FOR MANY YEARS I HAVE LONGED FOR A SERVANT TO HELP ME WITH THE HOUSEWORK AND TO COOK THE MEALS AND WASH THE DISHES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-105 NO SERVANT WILL COME HERE BECAUSE THE PLACE IS SO LONELY AND OUT OF THE WAY SO MY CLEVER HUSBAND THE CROOKED MAGICIAN PROPOSED THAT I MAKE A GIRL OUT OF SOME SORT OF MATERIAL AND HE WOULD MAKE HER LIVE BY SPRINKLING OVER HER THE POWDER OF LIFE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-106 THIS SEEMED AN EXCELLENT SUGGESTION AND AT ONCE DOCTOR PIPT SET TO WORK TO MAKE A NEW BATCH OF HIS MAGIC POWDER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-107 HE HAS BEEN AT IT A LONG LONG WHILE AND SO I HAVE HAD PLENTY OF TIME TO MAKE THE GIRL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-108 YET THAT TASK WAS NOT SO EASY AS YOU MAY SUPPOSE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-109 AT FIRST I COULDN'T THINK WHAT TO MAKE HER OF BUT FINALLY IN SEARCHING THROUGH A CHEST I CAME ACROSS AN OLD PATCHWORK QUILT WHICH MY GRANDMOTHER ONCE MADE WHEN SHE WAS YOUNG.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-110 WHAT IS A PATCHWORK QUILT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-111 ASKED OJO. A BED QUILT MADE OF PATCHES OF DIFFERENT KINDS AND COLORS OF CLOTH ALL NEATLY SEWED TOGETHER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-112 THE PATCHES ARE OF ALL SHAPES AND SIZES SO A PATCHWORK QUILT IS A VERY PRETTY AND GORGEOUS THING TO LOOK AT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-113 SOMETIMES IT IS CALLED A CRAZY QUILT BECAUSE THE PATCHES AND COLORS ARE SO MIXED UP.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-114 WE NEVER HAVE USED MY GRANDMOTHER'S MANY COLORED PATCHWORK QUILT HANDSOME AS IT IS FOR WE MUNCHKINS DO NOT CARE FOR ANY COLOR OTHER THAN BLUE SO IT HAS BEEN PACKED AWAY IN THE CHEST FOR ABOUT A HUNDRED YEARS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-115 WHEN I FOUND IT I SAID TO MYSELF THAT IT WOULD DO NICELY FOR MY SERVANT GIRL FOR WHEN SHE WAS BROUGHT TO LIFE SHE WOULD NOT BE PROUD NOR HAUGHTY AS THE GLASS CAT IS FOR SUCH A DREADFUL MIXTURE OF COLORS WOULD DISCOURAGE HER FROM TRYING TO BE AS DIGNIFIED AS THE BLUE MUNCHKINS ARE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-116 IS BLUE THE ONLY RESPECTABLE COLOR THEN?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-117 INQUIRED OJO. YES FOR A MUNCHKIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-118 ALL OUR COUNTRY IS BLUE YOU KNOW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-119 BUT IN OTHER PARTS OF OZ THE PEOPLE FAVOR DIFFERENT COLORS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-120 AT THE EMERALD CITY WHERE OUR PRINCESS OZMA LIVES GREEN IS THE POPULAR COLOR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-121 BUT ALL MUNCHKINS PREFER BLUE TO ANYTHING ELSE AND WHEN MY HOUSEWORK GIRL IS BROUGHT TO LIFE SHE WILL FIND HERSELF TO BE OF SO MANY UNPOPULAR COLORS THAT SHE'LL NEVER DARE BE REBELLIOUS OR IMPUDENT AS SERVANTS ARE SOMETIMES LIABLE TO BE WHEN THEY ARE MADE THE SAME WAY THEIR MISTRESSES ARE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-122 UNC NUNKIE NODDED APPROVAL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-123 GOOD I DEA HE SAID,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-124 AND THAT WAS A LONG SPEECH FOR UNC NUNKIE BECAUSE IT WAS TWO WORDS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-125 SO I CUT UP THE QUILT CONTINUED MARGOLOTTE AND MADE FROM IT A VERY WELL SHAPED GIRL WHICH I STUFFED WITH COTTON WADDING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-126 I WILL SHOW YOU WHAT A GOOD JOB I DID AND SHE WENT TO A TALL CUPBOARD AND THREW OPEN THE DOORS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-02-127 THEN BACK SHE CAME LUGGING IN HER ARMS THE PATCHWORK GIRL WHICH SHE SET UPON THE BENCH AND PROPPED UP SO THAT THE FIGURE WOULD NOT TUMBLE OVER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-01 CHAPTER THREE THE PATCHWORK GIRL OJO EXAMINED THIS CURIOUS CONTRIVANCE WITH WONDER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-02 THE PATCHWORK GIRL WAS TALLER THAN HE WHEN SHE STOOD UPRIGHT AND HER BODY WAS PLUMP AND ROUNDED BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN SO NEATLY STUFFED WITH COTTON.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-03 MARGOLOTTE HAD FIRST MADE THE GIRL'S FORM FROM THE PATCHWORK QUILT AND THEN SHE HAD DRESSED IT WITH A PATCHWORK SKIRT AND AN APRON WITH POCKETS IN IT USING THE SAME GAY MATERIAL THROUGHOUT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-04 UPON THE FEET SHE HAD SEWN A PAIR OF RED LEATHER SHOES WITH POINTED TOES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-05 ALL THE FINGERS AND THUMBS OF THE GIRL'S HANDS HAD BEEN CAREFULLY FORMED AND STUFFED AND STITCHED AT THE EDGES WITH GOLD PLATES AT THE ENDS TO SERVE AS FINGER NAILS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-06 SHE WILL HAVE TO WORK WHEN SHE COMES TO LIFE SAID MARGOLOTTE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-07 THE HEAD OF THE PATCHWORK GIRL WAS THE MOST CURIOUS PART OF HER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-08 WHILE SHE WAITED FOR HER HUSBAND TO FINISH MAKING HIS POWDER OF LIFE THE WOMAN HAD FOUND AMPLE TIME TO COMPLETE THE HEAD AS HER FANCY DICTATED AND SHE REALIZED THAT A GOOD SERVANT'S HEAD MUST BE PROPERLY CONSTRUCTED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-09 THE HAIR WAS OF BROWN YARN AND HUNG DOWN ON HER NECK IN SEVERAL NEAT BRAIDS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-10 HER EYES WERE TWO SILVER SUSPENDER BUTTONS CUT FROM A PAIR OF THE MAGICIAN'S OLD TROUSERS AND THEY WERE SEWED ON WITH BLACK THREADS WHICH FORMED THE PUPILS OF THE EYES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-11 MARGOLOTTE HAD PUZZLED OVER THE EARS FOR SOME TIME FOR THESE WERE IMPORTANT IF THE SERVANT WAS TO HEAR DISTINCTLY BUT FINALLY SHE HAD MADE THEM OUT OF THIN PLATES OF GOLD AND ATTACHED THEM IN PLACE BY MEANS OF STITCHES THROUGH TINY HOLES BORED IN THE METAL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-12 GOLD IS THE MOST COMMON METAL IN THE LAND OF OZ AND IS USED FOR MANY PURPOSES BECAUSE IT IS SOFT AND PLIABLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-13 THE WOMAN HAD CUT A SLIT FOR THE PATCHWORK GIRL'S MOUTH AND SEWN TWO ROWS OF WHITE PEARLS IN IT FOR TEETH USING A STRIP OF SCARLET PLUSH FOR A TONGUE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-14 THIS MOUTH OJO CONSIDERED VERY ARTISTIC AND LIFELIKE AND MARGOLOTTE WAS PLEASED WHEN THE BOY PRAISED IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-15 THERE WERE ALMOST TOO MANY PATCHES ON THE FACE OF THE GIRL FOR HER TO BE CONSIDERED STRICTLY BEAUTIFUL FOR ONE CHEEK WAS YELLOW AND THE OTHER RED HER CHIN BLUE HER FOREHEAD PURPLE AND THE CENTER WHERE HER NOSE HAD BEEN FORMED AND PADDED A BRIGHT YELLOW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-16 YOU OUGHT TO HAVE HAD HER FACE ALL PINK SUGGESTED THE BOY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-17 I SUPPOSE SO,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-18 BUT I HAD NO PINK CLOTH REPLIED THE WOMAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-19 STILL I CANNOT SEE AS IT MATTERS MUCH FOR I WISH MY PATCHWORK GIRL TO BE USEFUL RATHER THAN ORNAMENTAL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-20 IF I GET TIRED LOOKING AT HER PATCHED FACE I CAN WHITEWASH IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-21 HAS SHE ANY BRAINS?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-22 ASKED OJO. NO,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-23 I FORGOT ALL ABOUT THE BRAINS!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-24 EXCLAIMED THE WOMAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-25 I AM GLAD YOU REMINDED ME OF THEM FOR IT IS NOT TOO LATE TO SUPPLY THEM BY ANY MEANS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-26 UNTIL SHE IS BROUGHT TO LIFE I CAN DO ANYTHING I PLEASE WITH THIS GIRL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-27 BUT I MUST BE CAREFUL NOT TO GIVE HER TOO MUCH BRAINS AND THOSE SHE HAS MUST BE SUCH AS ARE FITTED TO THE STATION SHE IS TO OCCUPY IN LIFE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-28 IN OTHER WORDS HER BRAINS MUSTN'T BE VERY GOOD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-29 WRONG SAID UNC NUNKIE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-30 NO,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-31 I AM SURE I AM RIGHT ABOUT THAT RETURNED THE WOMAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-32 HE MEANS EXPLAINED OJO THAT UNLESS YOUR SERVANT HAS GOOD BRAINS SHE WON'T KNOW HOW TO OBEY YOU PROPERLY NOR DO THE THINGS YOU ASK HER TO DO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-33 WELL THAT MAY BE TRUE AGREED MARGOLOTTE,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-34 BUT ON THE CONTRARY A SERVANT WITH TOO MUCH BRAINS IS SURE TO BECOME INDEPENDENT AND HIGH AND MIGHTY AND FEEL ABOVE HER WORK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-35 THIS IS A VERY DELICATE TASK AS I SAID AND I MUST TAKE CARE TO GIVE THE GIRL JUST THE RIGHT QUANTITY OF THE RIGHT SORT OF BRAINS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-36 I WANT HER TO KNOW JUST ENOUGH BUT NOT TOO MUCH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-37 WITH THIS SHE WENT TO ANOTHER CUPBOARD WHICH WAS FILLED WITH SHELVES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-38 ALL THE SHELVES WERE LINED WITH BLUE GLASS BOTTLES NEATLY LABELED BY THE MAGICIAN TO SHOW WHAT THEY CONTAINED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-39 ONE WHOLE SHELF WAS MARKED, BRAIN FURNITURE AND THE BOTTLES ON THIS SHELF WERE LABELED AS FOLLOWS, OBEDIENCE CLEVERNESS JUDGMENT COURAGE INGENUITY AMIABILITY LEARNING TRUTH POESY SELF RELIANCE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-40 LET ME SEE SAID MARGOLOTTE,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-41 OF THOSE QUALITIES SHE MUST HAVE OBEDIENCE FIRST OF ALL AND SHE TOOK DOWN THE BOTTLE BEARING THAT LABEL AND POURED FROM IT UPON A DISH SEVERAL GRAINS OF THE CONTENTS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-42 AMIABILITY IS ALSO GOOD AND TRUTH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-43 SHE POURED INTO THE DISH A QUANTITY FROM EACH OF THESE BOTTLES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-44 I THINK THAT WILL DO SHE CONTINUED FOR THE OTHER QUALITIES ARE NOT NEEDED IN A SERVANT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-45 UNC NUNKIE WHO WITH OJO STOOD BESIDE HER TOUCHED THE BOTTLE MARKED CLEVERNESS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-46 LITTLE SAID HE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-47 A LITTLE CLEVERNESS'?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-48 WELL PERHAPS YOU ARE RIGHT SIR SAID SHE AND WAS ABOUT TO TAKE DOWN THE BOTTLE WHEN THE CROOKED MAGICIAN SUDDENLY CALLED TO HER EXCITEDLY FROM THE FIREPLACE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-49 QUICK MARGOLOTTE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-50 COME AND HELP ME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-51 SHE RAN TO HER HUSBAND'S SIDE AT ONCE AND HELPED HIM LIFT THE FOUR KETTLES FROM THE FIRE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-52 THEIR CONTENTS HAD ALL BOILED AWAY LEAVING IN THE BOTTOM OF EACH KETTLE A FEW GRAINS OF FINE WHITE POWDER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-53 VERY CAREFULLY THE MAGICIAN REMOVED THIS POWDER PLACING IT ALL TOGETHER IN A GOLDEN DISH WHERE HE MIXED IT WITH A GOLDEN SPOON.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-54 WHEN THE MIXTURE WAS COMPLETE THERE WAS SCARCELY A HANDFUL ALL TOLD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-55 THAT SAID DOCTOR PIPT IN A PLEASED AND TRIUMPHANT TONE IS THE WONDERFUL POWDER OF LIFE WHICH I ALONE IN THE WORLD KNOW HOW TO MAKE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-56 IT HAS TAKEN ME NEARLY SIX YEARS TO PREPARE THESE PRECIOUS GRAINS OF DUST BUT THE LITTLE HEAP ON THAT DISH IS WORTH THE PRICE OF A KINGDOM AND MANY A KING WOULD GIVE ALL HE HAS TO POSSESS IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-57 WHEN IT HAS BECOME COOLED I WILL PLACE IT IN A SMALL BOTTLE,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-58 BUT MEANTIME I MUST WATCH IT CAREFULLY LEST A GUST OF WIND BLOW IT AWAY OR SCATTER IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-59 UNC NUNKIE MARGOLOTTE AND THE MAGICIAN ALL STOOD LOOKING AT THE MARVELOUS POWDER BUT OJO WAS MORE INTERESTED JUST THEN IN THE PATCHWORK GIRL'S BRAINS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-60 THINKING IT BOTH UNFAIR AND UNKIND TO DEPRIVE HER OF ANY GOOD QUALITIES THAT WERE HANDY THE BOY TOOK DOWN EVERY BOTTLE ON THE SHELF AND POURED SOME OF THE CONTENTS IN MARGOLOTTE'S DISH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-61 NO ONE SAW HIM DO THIS FOR ALL WERE LOOKING AT THE POWDER OF LIFE,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-62 BUT SOON THE WOMAN REMEMBERED WHAT SHE HAD BEEN DOING AND CAME BACK TO THE CUPBOARD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-63 LET'S SEE SHE REMARKED,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-64 I WAS ABOUT TO GIVE MY GIRL A LITTLE CLEVERNESS WHICH IS THE DOCTOR'S SUBSTITUTE FOR INTELLIGENCE A QUALITY HE HAS NOT YET LEARNED HOW TO MANUFACTURE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-65 TAKING DOWN THE BOTTLE OF CLEVERNESS SHE ADDED SOME OF THE POWDER TO THE HEAP ON THE DISH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-66 OJO BECAME A BIT UNEASY AT THIS FOR HE HAD ALREADY PUT QUITE A LOT OF THE CLEVERNESS POWDER IN THE DISH,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-67 BUT HE DARED NOT INTERFERE AND SO HE COMFORTED HIMSELF WITH THE THOUGHT THAT ONE CANNOT HAVE TOO MUCH CLEVERNESS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-68 MARGOLOTTE NOW CARRIED THE DISH OF BRAINS TO THE BENCH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-69 RIPPING THE SEAM OF THE PATCH ON THE GIRL'S FOREHEAD SHE PLACED THE POWDER WITHIN THE HEAD AND THEN SEWED UP THE SEAM AS NEATLY AND SECURELY AS BEFORE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-70 MY GIRL IS ALL READY FOR YOUR POWDER OF LIFE MY DEAR SHE SAID TO HER HUSBAND.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-71 BUT THE MAGICIAN REPLIED, THIS POWDER MUST NOT BE USED BEFORE TO MORROW MORNING,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-72 BUT I THINK IT IS NOW COOL ENOUGH TO BE BOTTLED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-73 HE SELECTED A SMALL GOLD BOTTLE WITH A PEPPER BOX TOP SO THAT THE POWDER MIGHT BE SPRINKLED ON ANY OBJECT THROUGH THE SMALL HOLES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-74 VERY CAREFULLY HE PLACED THE POWDER OF LIFE IN THE GOLD BOTTLE AND THEN LOCKED IT UP IN A DRAWER OF HIS CABINET.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-75 AT LAST SAID HE RUBBING HIS HANDS TOGETHER GLEEFULLY I HAVE AMPLE LEISURE FOR A GOOD TALK WITH MY OLD FRIEND UNC NUNKIE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-76 SO LET US SIT DOWN COSILY AND ENJOY OURSELVES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-77 AFTER STIRRING THOSE FOUR KETTLES FOR SIX YEARS I AM GLAD TO HAVE A LITTLE REST.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-78 YOU WILL HAVE TO DO MOST OF THE TALKING SAID OJO FOR UNC IS CALLED THE SILENT ONE AND USES FEW WORDS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-79 I KNOW,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-80 BUT THAT RENDERS YOUR UNCLE A MOST AGREEABLE COMPANION AND GOSSIP DECLARED DOCTOR PIPT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-81 MOST PEOPLE TALK TOO MUCH SO IT IS A RELIEF TO FIND ONE WHO TALKS TOO LITTLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-82 OJO LOOKED AT THE MAGICIAN WITH MUCH AWE AND CURIOSITY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-83 DON'T YOU FIND IT VERY ANNOYING TO BE SO CROOKED?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-84 HE ASKED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-85 NO,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-86 I AM QUITE PROUD OF MY PERSON WAS THE REPLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-87 I SUPPOSE I AM THE ONLY CROOKED MAGICIAN IN ALL THE WORLD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-88 SOME OTHERS ARE ACCUSED OF BEING CROOKED BUT I AM THE ONLY GENUINE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-89 HE WAS REALLY VERY CROOKED AND OJO WONDERED HOW HE MANAGED TO DO SO MANY THINGS WITH SUCH A TWISTED BODY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-90 WHEN HE SAT DOWN UPON A CROOKED CHAIR THAT HAD BEEN MADE TO FIT HIM ONE KNEE WAS UNDER HIS CHIN AND THE OTHER NEAR THE SMALL OF HIS BACK,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-91 BUT HE WAS A CHEERFUL MAN AND HIS FACE BORE A PLEASANT AND AGREEABLE EXPRESSION.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-92 I AM NOT ALLOWED TO PERFORM MAGIC EXCEPT FOR MY OWN AMUSEMENT HE TOLD HIS VISITORS AS HE LIGHTED A PIPE WITH A CROOKED STEM AND BEGAN TO SMOKE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-93 TOO MANY PEOPLE WERE WORKING MAGIC IN THE LAND OF OZ AND SO OUR LOVELY PRINCESS OZMA PUT A STOP TO IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-94 I THINK SHE WAS QUITE RIGHT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-95 THERE WERE SEVERAL WICKED WITCHES WHO CAUSED A LOT OF TROUBLE,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-96 BUT NOW THEY ARE ALL OUT OF BUSINESS AND ONLY THE GREAT SORCERESS GLINDA THE GOOD IS PERMITTED TO PRACTICE HER ARTS WHICH NEVER HARM ANYBODY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-97 THE WIZARD OF OZ WHO USED TO BE A HUMBUG AND KNEW NO MAGIC AT ALL HAS BEEN TAKING LESSONS OF GLINDA AND I'M TOLD HE IS GETTING TO BE A PRETTY GOOD WIZARD,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-98 BUT HE IS MERELY THE ASSISTANT OF THE GREAT SORCERESS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-99 I'VE THE RIGHT TO MAKE A SERVANT GIRL FOR MY WIFE YOU KNOW OR A GLASS CAT TO CATCH OUR MICE WHICH SHE REFUSES TO DO BUT I AM FORBIDDEN TO WORK MAGIC FOR OTHERS OR TO USE IT AS A PROFESSION.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-100 MAGIC MUST BE A VERY INTERESTING STUDY SAID OJO. IT TRULY IS ASSERTED THE MAGICIAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-101 IN MY TIME I'VE PERFORMED SOME MAGICAL FEATS THAT WERE WORTHY OF THE SKILL OF GLINDA THE GOOD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-102 FOR INSTANCE THERE'S THE POWDER OF LIFE AND MY LIQUID OF PETRIFACTION WHICH IS CONTAINED IN THAT BOTTLE ON THE SHELF YONDER OVER THE WINDOW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-103 WHAT DOES THE LIQUID OF PETRIFACTION DO?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-104 INQUIRED THE BOY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-105 TURNS EVERYTHING IT TOUCHES TO SOLID MARBLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-106 IT'S AN INVENTION OF MY OWN AND I FIND IT VERY USEFUL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-107 ONCE TWO OF THOSE DREADFUL KALIDAHS WITH BODIES LIKE BEARS AND HEADS LIKE TIGERS CAME HERE FROM THE FOREST TO ATTACK US,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-108 BUT I SPRINKLED SOME OF THAT LIQUID ON THEM AND INSTANTLY THEY TURNED TO MARBLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-109 I NOW USE THEM AS ORNAMENTAL STATUARY IN MY GARDEN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-110 THIS TABLE LOOKS TO YOU LIKE WOOD AND ONCE IT REALLY WAS WOOD,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-111 BUT I SPRINKLED A FEW DROPS OF THE LIQUID OF PETRIFACTION ON IT AND NOW IT IS MARBLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-112 IT WILL NEVER BREAK NOR WEAR OUT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-113 FINE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-114 SAID UNC NUNKIE WAGGING HIS HEAD AND STROKING HIS LONG GRAY BEARD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-115 DEAR ME,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-116 WHAT A CHATTERBOX YOU'RE GETTING TO BE UNC REMARKED THE MAGICIAN WHO WAS PLEASED WITH THE COMPLIMENT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-117 BUT JUST THEN THERE CAME A SCRATCHING AT THE BACK DOOR AND A SHRILL VOICE CRIED, LET ME IN!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-118 HURRY UP CAN'T YOU?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-119 MARGOLOTTE GOT UP AND WENT TO THE DOOR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-120 ASK LIKE A GOOD CAT THEN SHE SAID.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-121 THE VOICE IN SCORNFUL ACCENTS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-122 YES,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-123 THAT'S PROPER CAT TALK DECLARED THE WOMAN AND OPENED THE DOOR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-124 AT ONCE A CAT ENTERED CAME TO THE CENTER OF THE ROOM AND STOPPED SHORT AT THE SIGHT OF STRANGERS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-03-125 OJO AND UNC NUNKIE BOTH STARED AT IT WITH WIDE OPEN EYES FOR SURELY NO SUCH CURIOUS CREATURE HAD EVER EXISTED BEFORE EVEN IN THE LAND OF OZ.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-01 CHAPTER FOUR THE GLASS CAT THE CAT WAS MADE OF GLASS SO CLEAR AND TRANSPARENT THAT YOU COULD SEE THROUGH IT AS EASILY AS THROUGH A WINDOW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-02 IN THE TOP OF ITS HEAD HOWEVER WAS A MASS OF DELICATE PINK BALLS WHICH LOOKED LIKE JEWELS AND IT HAD A HEART MADE OF A BLOOD RED RUBY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-03 THE EYES WERE TWO LARGE EMERALDS BUT ASIDE FROM THESE COLORS ALL THE REST OF THE ANIMAL WAS CLEAR GLASS AND IT HAD A SPUN GLASS TAIL THAT WAS REALLY BEAUTIFUL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-04 WELL DOC PIPT DO YOU MEAN TO INTRODUCE US OR NOT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-05 DEMANDED THE CAT IN A TONE OF ANNOYANCE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-06 SEEMS TO ME YOU ARE FORGETTING YOUR MANNERS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-07 EXCUSE ME RETURNED THE MAGICIAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-08 THIS IS UNC NUNKIE THE DESCENDANT OF THE FORMER KINGS OF THE MUNCHKINS BEFORE THIS COUNTRY BECAME A PART OF THE LAND OF OZ. HE NEEDS A HAIRCUT OBSERVED THE CAT WASHING ITS FACE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-09 TRUE REPLIED UNC WITH A LOW CHUCKLE OF AMUSEMENT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-10 BUT HE HAS LIVED ALONE IN THE HEART OF THE FOREST FOR MANY YEARS THE MAGICIAN EXPLAINED,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-11 AND ALTHOUGH THAT IS A BARBAROUS COUNTRY THERE ARE NO BARBERS THERE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-12 WHO IS THE DWARF?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-13 ASKED THE CAT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-14 THAT IS NOT A DWARF BUT A BOY ANSWERED THE MAGICIAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-15 YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN A BOY BEFORE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-16 HE IS NOW SMALL BECAUSE HE IS YOUNG.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-17 OH. IS THAT MAGIC?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-18 THE GLASS ANIMAL INQUIRED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-19 YES,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-20 BUT IT IS NATURE'S MAGIC WHICH IS MORE WONDERFUL THAN ANY ART KNOWN TO MAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-21 FOR INSTANCE MY MAGIC MADE YOU AND MADE YOU LIVE,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-22 AND IT WAS A POOR JOB BECAUSE YOU ARE USELESS AND A BOTHER TO ME,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-23 BUT I CAN'T MAKE YOU GROW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-24 YOU WILL ALWAYS BE THE SAME SIZE AND THE SAME SAUCY INCONSIDERATE GLASS CAT WITH PINK BRAINS AND A HARD RUBY HEART.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-25 NO ONE CAN REGRET MORE THAN I THE FACT THAT YOU MADE ME ASSERTED THE CAT CROUCHING UPON THE FLOOR AND SLOWLY SWAYING ITS SPUN GLASS TAIL FROM SIDE TO SIDE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-26 YOUR WORLD IS A VERY UNINTERESTING PLACE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-27 I'VE WANDERED THROUGH YOUR GARDENS AND IN THE FOREST UNTIL I'M TIRED OF IT ALL AND WHEN I COME INTO THE HOUSE THE CONVERSATION OF YOUR FAT WIFE AND OF YOURSELF BORES ME DREADFULLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-28 THAT IS BECAUSE I GAVE YOU DIFFERENT BRAINS FROM THOSE WE OURSELVES POSSESS AND MUCH TOO GOOD FOR A CAT RETURNED DOCTOR PIPT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-29 CAN'T YOU TAKE EM OUT THEN AND REPLACE EM WITH PEBBLES SO THAT I WON'T FEEL ABOVE MY STATION IN LIFE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-30 ASKED THE CAT PLEADINGLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-31 PERHAPS SO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-32 I'LL TRY IT AFTER I'VE BROUGHT THE PATCHWORK GIRL TO LIFE HE SAID.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-33 THE CAT WALKED UP TO THE BENCH ON WHICH THE PATCHWORK GIRL RECLINED AND LOOKED AT HER ATTENTIVELY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-34 ARE YOU GOING TO MAKE THAT DREADFUL THING LIVE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-35 SHE ASKED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-36 THE MAGICIAN NODDED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-37 IT IS INTENDED TO BE MY WIFE'S SERVANT MAID HE SAID.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-38 WHEN SHE IS ALIVE SHE WILL DO ALL OUR WORK AND MIND THE HOUSE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-39 BUT YOU ARE NOT TO ORDER HER AROUND BUNGLE AS YOU DO US.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-40 YOU MUST TREAT THE PATCHWORK GIRL RESPECTFULLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-41 I WON'T.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-42 I COULDN'T RESPECT SUCH A BUNDLE OF SCRAPS UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-43 IF YOU DON'T THERE WILL BE MORE SCRAPS THAN YOU WILL LIKE CRIED MARGOLOTTE ANGRILY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-44 WHY DIDN'T YOU MAKE HER PRETTY TO LOOK AT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-45 ASKED THE CAT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-46 YOU MADE ME PRETTY VERY PRETTY INDEED AND I LOVE TO WATCH MY PINK BRAINS ROLL AROUND WHEN THEY'RE WORKING AND TO SEE MY PRECIOUS RED HEART BEAT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-47 SHE WENT TO A LONG MIRROR AS SHE SAID THIS AND STOOD BEFORE IT LOOKING AT HERSELF WITH AN AIR OF MUCH PRIDE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-48 BUT THAT POOR PATCHED THING WILL HATE HERSELF WHEN SHE'S ONCE ALIVE CONTINUED THE CAT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-49 IF I WERE YOU I'D USE HER FOR A MOP AND MAKE ANOTHER SERVANT THAT IS PRETTIER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-50 YOU HAVE A PERVERTED TASTE SNAPPED MARGOLOTTE MUCH ANNOYED AT THIS FRANK CRITICISM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-51 I THINK THE PATCHWORK GIRL IS BEAUTIFUL CONSIDERING WHAT SHE'S MADE OF.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-52 EVEN THE RAINBOW HASN'T AS MANY COLORS AND YOU MUST ADMIT THAT THE RAINBOW IS A PRETTY THING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-53 THE GLASS CAT YAWNED AND STRETCHED HERSELF UPON THE FLOOR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-54 HAVE YOUR OWN WAY SHE SAID.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-55 I'M SORRY FOR THE PATCHWORK GIRL THAT'S ALL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-56 OJO AND UNC NUNKIE SLEPT THAT NIGHT IN THE MAGICIAN'S HOUSE AND THE BOY WAS GLAD TO STAY BECAUSE HE WAS ANXIOUS TO SEE THE PATCHWORK GIRL BROUGHT TO LIFE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-57 THE GLASS CAT WAS ALSO A WONDERFUL CREATURE TO LITTLE OJO WHO HAD NEVER SEEN OR KNOWN ANYTHING OF MAGIC BEFORE ALTHOUGH HE HAD LIVED IN THE FAIRYLAND OF OZ EVER SINCE HE WAS BORN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-58 BACK THERE IN THE WOODS NOTHING UNUSUAL EVER HAPPENED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-59 NUNKIE WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN KING OF THE MUNCHKINS HAD NOT HIS PEOPLE UNITED WITH ALL THE OTHER COUNTRIES OF OZ IN ACKNOWLEDGING OZMA AS THEIR SOLE RULER HAD RETIRED INTO THIS FORGOTTEN FOREST NOOK WITH HIS BABY NEPHEW AND THEY HAD LIVED ALL ALONE THERE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-60 ONLY THAT THE NEGLECTED GARDEN HAD FAILED TO GROW FOOD FOR THEM THEY WOULD ALWAYS HAVE LIVED IN THE SOLITARY BLUE FOREST,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-61 BUT NOW THEY HAD STARTED OUT TO MINGLE WITH OTHER PEOPLE AND THE FIRST PLACE THEY CAME TO PROVED SO INTERESTING THAT OJO COULD SCARCELY SLEEP A WINK ALL NIGHT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-62 MARGOLOTTE WAS AN EXCELLENT COOK AND GAVE THEM A FINE BREAKFAST.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-63 WHILE THEY WERE ALL ENGAGED IN EATING THE GOOD WOMAN SAID, THIS IS THE LAST MEAL I SHALL HAVE TO COOK FOR SOME TIME FOR RIGHT AFTER BREAKFAST DOCTOR PIPT HAS PROMISED TO BRING MY NEW SERVANT TO LIFE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-64 I SHALL LET HER WASH THE BREAKFAST DISHES AND SWEEP AND DUST THE HOUSE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-65 WHAT A RELIEF IT WILL BE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-66 IT WILL INDEED RELIEVE YOU OF MUCH DRUDGERY SAID THE MAGICIAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-67 BY THE WAY MARGOLOTTE I THOUGHT I SAW YOU GETTING SOME BRAINS FROM THE CUPBOARD WHILE I WAS BUSY WITH MY KETTLES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-68 WHAT QUALITIES HAVE YOU GIVEN YOUR NEW SERVANT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-69 ONLY THOSE THAT AN HUMBLE SERVANT REQUIRES SHE ANSWERED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-70 I DO NOT WISH HER TO FEEL ABOVE HER STATION AS THE GLASS CAT DOES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-71 THAT WOULD MAKE HER DISCONTENTED AND UNHAPPY FOR OF COURSE SHE MUST ALWAYS BE A SERVANT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-72 OJO WAS SOMEWHAT DISTURBED AS HE LISTENED TO THIS AND THE BOY BEGAN TO FEAR HE HAD DONE WRONG IN ADDING ALL THOSE DIFFERENT QUALITIES OF BRAINS TO THE LOT MARGOLOTTE HAD PREPARED FOR THE SERVANT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-73 BUT IT WAS TOO LATE NOW FOR REGRET SINCE ALL THE BRAINS WERE SECURELY SEWN UP INSIDE THE PATCHWORK GIRL'S HEAD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-74 HE MIGHT HAVE CONFESSED WHAT HE HAD DONE AND THUS ALLOWED MARGOLOTTE AND HER HUSBAND TO CHANGE THE BRAINS,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-75 BUT HE WAS AFRAID OF INCURRING THEIR ANGER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-76 HE BELIEVED THAT UNC HAD SEEN HIM ADD TO THE BRAINS AND UNC HAD NOT SAID A WORD AGAINST IT,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-77 BUT THEN UNC NEVER DID SAY ANYTHING UNLESS IT WAS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-78 AS SOON AS BREAKFAST WAS OVER THEY ALL WENT INTO THE MAGICIAN'S BIG WORKSHOP WHERE THE GLASS CAT WAS LYING BEFORE THE MIRROR AND THE PATCHWORK GIRL LAY LIMP AND LIFELESS UPON THE BENCH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-79 NOW THEN SAID DOCTOR PIPT IN A BRISK TONE WE SHALL PERFORM ONE OF THE GREATEST FEATS OF MAGIC POSSIBLE TO MAN EVEN IN THIS MARVELOUS LAND OF OZ. IN NO OTHER COUNTRY COULD IT BE DONE AT ALL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-80 I THINK WE OUGHT TO HAVE A LITTLE MUSIC WHILE THE PATCHWORK GIRL COMES TO LIFE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-81 IT IS PLEASANT TO REFLECT THAT THE FIRST SOUNDS HER GOLDEN EARS WILL HEAR WILL BE DELICIOUS MUSIC.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-82 AS HE SPOKE HE WENT TO A PHONOGRAPH WHICH SCREWED FAST TO A SMALL TABLE AND WOUND UP THE SPRING OF THE INSTRUMENT AND ADJUSTED THE BIG GOLD HORN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-83 THE MUSIC MY SERVANT WILL USUALLY HEAR REMARKED MARGOLOTTE WILL BE MY ORDERS TO DO HER WORK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-84 BUT I SEE NO HARM IN ALLOWING HER TO LISTEN TO THIS UNSEEN BAND WHILE SHE WAKENS TO HER FIRST REALIZATION OF LIFE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-85 MY ORDERS WILL BEAT THE BAND AFTERWARD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-86 THE PHONOGRAPH WAS NOW PLAYING A STIRRING MARCH TUNE AND THE MAGICIAN UNLOCKED HIS CABINET AND TOOK OUT THE GOLD BOTTLE CONTAINING THE POWDER OF LIFE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-87 THEY ALL BENT OVER THE BENCH ON WHICH THE PATCHWORK GIRL RECLINED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-88 UNC NUNKIE AND MARGOLOTTE STOOD BEHIND NEAR THE WINDOWS OJO AT ONE SIDE AND THE MAGICIAN IN FRONT WHERE HE WOULD HAVE FREEDOM TO SPRINKLE THE POWDER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-89 THE GLASS CAT CAME NEAR TOO CURIOUS TO WATCH THE IMPORTANT SCENE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-90 ALL READY?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-91 ASKED DOCTOR PIPT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-92 ALL IS READY ANSWERED HIS WIFE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-04-93 SO THE MAGICIAN LEANED OVER AND SHOOK FROM THE BOTTLE SOME GRAINS OF THE WONDERFUL POWDER AND THEY FELL DIRECTLY ON THE PATCHWORK GIRL'S HEAD AND ARMS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-01 CHAPTER FIVE A TERRIBLE ACCIDENT IT WILL TAKE A FEW MINUTES FOR THIS POWDER TO DO ITS WORK REMARKED THE MAGICIAN SPRINKLING THE BODY UP AND DOWN WITH MUCH CARE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-02 BUT SUDDENLY THE PATCHWORK GIRL THREW UP ONE ARM WHICH KNOCKED THE BOTTLE OF POWDER FROM THE CROOKED MAN'S HAND AND SENT IT FLYING ACROSS THE ROOM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-03 UNC NUNKIE AND MARGOLOTTE WERE SO STARTLED THAT THEY BOTH LEAPED BACKWARD AND BUMPED TOGETHER AND UNC'S HEAD JOGGLED THE SHELF ABOVE THEM AND UPSET THE BOTTLE CONTAINING THE LIQUID OF PETRIFACTION.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-04 THE MAGICIAN UTTERED SUCH A WILD CRY THAT OJO JUMPED AWAY AND THE PATCHWORK GIRL SPRANG AFTER HIM AND CLASPED HER STUFFED ARMS AROUND HIM IN TERROR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-05 THE GLASS CAT SNARLED AND HID UNDER THE TABLE AND SO IT WAS THAT WHEN THE POWERFUL LIQUID OF PETRIFACTION WAS SPILLED IT FELL ONLY UPON THE WIFE OF THE MAGICIAN AND THE UNCLE OF OJO. WITH THESE TWO THE CHARM WORKED PROMPTLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-06 THEY STOOD MOTIONLESS AND STIFF AS MARBLE STATUES IN EXACTLY THE POSITIONS THEY WERE IN WHEN THE LIQUID STRUCK THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-07 OJO PUSHED THE PATCHWORK GIRL AWAY AND RAN TO UNC NUNKIE FILLED WITH A TERRIBLE FEAR FOR THE ONLY FRIEND AND PROTECTOR HE HAD EVER KNOWN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-08 WHEN HE GRASPED UNC'S HAND IT WAS COLD AND HARD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-09 EVEN THE LONG GRAY BEARD WAS SOLID MARBLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-10 THE CROOKED MAGICIAN WAS DANCING AROUND THE ROOM IN A FRENZY OF DESPAIR CALLING UPON HIS WIFE TO FORGIVE HIM TO SPEAK TO HIM TO COME TO LIFE AGAIN!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-11 THE PATCHWORK GIRL QUICKLY RECOVERING FROM HER FRIGHT NOW CAME NEARER AND LOOKED FROM ONE TO ANOTHER OF THE PEOPLE WITH DEEP INTEREST.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-12 THEN SHE LOOKED AT HERSELF AND LAUGHED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-13 NOTICING THE MIRROR SHE STOOD BEFORE IT AND EXAMINED HER EXTRAORDINARY FEATURES WITH AMAZEMENT HER BUTTON EYES PEARL BEAD TEETH AND PUFFY NOSE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-14 THEN ADDRESSING HER REFLECTION IN THE GLASS SHE EXCLAIMED, WHEE BUT THERE'S A GAUDY DAME!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-15 MAKES A PAINT BOX BLUSH WITH SHAME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-16 RAZZLE DAZZLE FIZZLE FAZZLE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-17 HOWDY DO MISS WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-18 SHE BOWED AND THE REFLECTION BOWED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-19 THEN SHE LAUGHED AGAIN LONG AND MERRILY AND THE GLASS CAT CREPT OUT FROM UNDER THE TABLE AND SAID, I DON'T BLAME YOU FOR LAUGHING AT YOURSELF.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-20 AREN'T YOU HORRID?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-21 HORRID?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-22 SHE REPLIED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-23 WHY I'M THOROUGHLY DELIGHTFUL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-24 I'M AN ORIGINAL IF YOU PLEASE AND THEREFORE INCOMPARABLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-25 OF ALL THE COMIC ABSURD RARE AND AMUSING CREATURES THE WORLD CONTAINS I MUST BE THE SUPREME FREAK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-26 WHO BUT POOR MARGOLOTTE COULD HAVE MANAGED TO INVENT SUCH AN UNREASONABLE BEING AS I?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-27 BUT I'M GLAD I'M AWFULLY GLAD!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-28 THAT I'M JUST WHAT I AM AND NOTHING ELSE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-29 BE QUIET WILL YOU?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-30 CRIED THE FRANTIC MAGICIAN,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-31 BE QUIET AND LET ME THINK!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-32 IF I DON'T THINK I SHALL GO MAD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-33 THINK AHEAD SAID THE PATCHWORK GIRL SEATING HERSELF IN A CHAIR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-34 THINK ALL YOU WANT TO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-35 I DON'T MIND.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-36 GEE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-37 BUT I'M TIRED PLAYING THAT TUNE CALLED THE PHONOGRAPH SPEAKING THROUGH ITS HORN IN A BRAZEN SCRATCHY VOICE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-38 IF YOU DON'T MIND PIPT OLD BOY I'LL CUT IT OUT AND TAKE A REST.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-39 THE MAGICIAN LOOKED GLOOMILY AT THE MUSIC MACHINE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-40 WHAT DREADFUL LUCK!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-41 HE WAILED DESPONDENTLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-42 THE POWDER OF LIFE MUST HAVE FALLEN ON THE PHONOGRAPH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-43 HE WENT UP TO IT AND FOUND THAT THE GOLD BOTTLE THAT CONTAINED THE PRECIOUS POWDER HAD DROPPED UPON THE STAND AND SCATTERED ITS LIFE GIVING GRAINS OVER THE MACHINE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-44 THE PHONOGRAPH WAS VERY MUCH ALIVE AND BEGAN DANCING A JIG WITH THE LEGS OF THE TABLE TO WHICH IT WAS ATTACHED AND THIS DANCE SO ANNOYED DOCTOR PIPT THAT HE KICKED THE THING INTO A CORNER AND PUSHED A BENCH AGAINST IT TO HOLD IT QUIET.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-45 YOU WERE BAD ENOUGH BEFORE SAID THE MAGICIAN RESENTFULLY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-46 BUT A LIVE PHONOGRAPH IS ENOUGH TO DRIVE EVERY SANE PERSON IN THE LAND OF OZ STARK CRAZY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-47 NO INSULTS PLEASE ANSWERED THE PHONOGRAPH IN A SURLY TONE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-48 YOU DID IT MY BOY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-49 DON'T BLAME ME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-50 YOU'VE BUNGLED EVERYTHING DOCTOR PIPT ADDED THE GLASS CAT CONTEMPTUOUSLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-51 EXCEPT ME SAID THE PATCHWORK GIRL JUMPING UP TO WHIRL MERRILY AROUND THE ROOM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-52 I THINK SAID OJO ALMOST READY TO CRY THROUGH GRIEF OVER UNC NUNKIE'S SAD FATE IT MUST ALL BE MY FAULT IN SOME WAY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-53 I'M CALLED OJO THE UNLUCKY YOU KNOW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-54 THAT'S NONSENSE KIDDIE RETORTED THE PATCHWORK GIRL CHEERFULLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-55 NO ONE CAN BE UNLUCKY WHO HAS THE INTELLIGENCE TO DIRECT HIS OWN ACTIONS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-56 THE UNLUCKY ONES ARE THOSE WHO BEG FOR A CHANCE TO THINK LIKE POOR DOCTOR PIPT HERE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-57 WHAT'S THE ROW ABOUT ANYWAY MISTER MAGIC MAKER?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-58 THE LIQUID OF PETRIFACTION HAS ACCIDENTALLY FALLEN UPON MY DEAR WIFE AND UNC NUNKIE AND TURNED THEM INTO MARBLE HE SADLY REPLIED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-59 WELL WHY DON'T YOU SPRINKLE SOME OF THAT POWDER ON THEM AND BRING THEM TO LIFE AGAIN?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-60 ASKED THE PATCHWORK GIRL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-61 THE MAGICIAN GAVE A JUMP.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-62 WHY I HADN'T THOUGHT OF THAT!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-63 HE JOYFULLY CRIED AND GRABBED UP THE GOLDEN BOTTLE WITH WHICH HE RAN TO MARGOLOTTE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-64 SAID THE PATCHWORK GIRL, HIGGLEDY PIGGLEDY DEE WHAT FOOLS MAGICIANS BE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-65 HIS HEAD'S SO THICK HE CAN'T THINK QUICK SO HE TAKES ADVICE FROM ME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-66 STANDING UPON THE BENCH FOR HE WAS SO CROOKED HE COULD NOT REACH THE TOP OF HIS WIFE'S HEAD IN ANY OTHER WAY DOCTOR PIPT BEGAN SHAKING THE BOTTLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-67 BUT NOT A GRAIN OF POWDER CAME OUT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-68 HE PULLED OFF THE COVER GLANCED WITHIN AND THEN THREW THE BOTTLE FROM HIM WITH A WAIL OF DESPAIR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-69 GONE GONE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-70 EVERY BIT GONE HE CRIED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-71 WASTED ON THAT MISERABLE PHONOGRAPH WHEN IT MIGHT HAVE SAVED MY DEAR WIFE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-72 THEN THE MAGICIAN BOWED HIS HEAD ON HIS CROOKED ARMS AND BEGAN TO CRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-73 OJO WAS SORRY FOR HIM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-74 HE WENT UP TO THE SORROWFUL MAN AND SAID SOFTLY, YOU CAN MAKE MORE POWDER OF LIFE DOCTOR PIPT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-75 YES,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-76 BUT IT WILL TAKE ME SIX YEARS SIX LONG WEARY YEARS OF STIRRING FOUR KETTLES WITH BOTH FEET AND BOTH HANDS WAS THE AGONIZED REPLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-77 SIX YEARS!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-78 WHILE POOR MARGOLOTTE STANDS WATCHING ME AS A MARBLE IMAGE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-79 CAN'T ANYTHING ELSE BE DONE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-80 ASKED THE PATCHWORK GIRL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-81 THE MAGICIAN SHOOK HIS HEAD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-82 THEN HE SEEMED TO REMEMBER SOMETHING AND LOOKED UP.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-83 THERE IS ONE OTHER COMPOUND THAT WOULD DESTROY THE MAGIC SPELL OF THE LIQUID OF PETRIFACTION AND RESTORE MY WIFE AND UNC NUNKIE TO LIFE SAID HE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-84 IT MAY BE HARD TO FIND THE THINGS I NEED TO MAKE THIS MAGIC COMPOUND BUT IF THEY WERE FOUND I COULD DO IN AN INSTANT WHAT WILL OTHERWISE TAKE SIX LONG WEARY YEARS OF STIRRING KETTLES WITH BOTH HANDS AND BOTH FEET.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-85 ALL RIGHT,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-86 LET'S FIND THE THINGS THEN SUGGESTED THE PATCHWORK GIRL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-87 THAT SEEMS A LOT MORE SENSIBLE THAN THOSE STIRRING TIMES WITH THE KETTLES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-88 THAT'S THE IDEA SCRAPS SAID THE GLASS CAT APPROVINGLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-89 I'M GLAD TO FIND YOU HAVE DECENT BRAINS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-90 MINE ARE EXCEPTIONALLY GOOD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-91 YOU CAN SEE EM WORK,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-92 THEY'RE PINK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-93 SCRAPS?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-94 REPEATED THE GIRL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-95 DID YOU CALL ME SCRAPS'?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-96 IS THAT MY NAME?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-97 I I BELIEVE MY POOR WIFE HAD INTENDED TO NAME YOU ANGELINE SAID THE MAGICIAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-98 BUT I LIKE SCRAPS BEST SHE REPLIED WITH A LAUGH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-99 IT FITS ME BETTER FOR MY PATCHWORK IS ALL SCRAPS AND NOTHING ELSE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-100 THANK YOU FOR NAMING ME MISS CAT. HAVE YOU ANY NAME OF YOUR OWN?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-101 I HAVE A FOOLISH NAME THAT MARGOLOTTE ONCE GAVE ME BUT WHICH IS QUITE UNDIGNIFIED FOR ONE OF MY IMPORTANCE ANSWERED THE CAT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-102 SHE CALLED ME BUNGLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-103 YES SIGHED THE MAGICIAN,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-104 YOU WERE A SAD BUNGLE TAKEN ALL IN ALL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-105 I WAS WRONG TO MAKE YOU AS I DID FOR A MORE USELESS CONCEITED AND BRITTLE THING NEVER BEFORE EXISTED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-106 I'M NOT SO BRITTLE AS YOU THINK RETORTED THE CAT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-107 I'VE BEEN ALIVE A GOOD MANY YEARS FOR DOCTOR PIPT EXPERIMENTED ON ME WITH THE FIRST MAGIC POWDER OF LIFE HE EVER MADE AND SO FAR I'VE NEVER BROKEN OR CRACKED OR CHIPPED ANY PART OF ME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-108 YOU SEEM TO HAVE A CHIP ON YOUR SHOULDER LAUGHED THE PATCHWORK GIRL AND THE CAT WENT TO THE MIRROR TO SEE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-109 TELL ME PLEADED OJO SPEAKING TO THE CROOKED MAGICIAN WHAT MUST WE FIND TO MAKE THE COMPOUND THAT WILL SAVE UNC NUNKIE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-110 FIRST WAS THE REPLY I MUST HAVE A SIX LEAVED CLOVER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-111 THAT CAN ONLY BE FOUND IN THE GREEN COUNTRY AROUND THE EMERALD CITY AND SIX LEAVED CLOVERS ARE VERY SCARCE EVEN THERE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-112 I'LL FIND IT FOR YOU PROMISED OJO. THE NEXT THING CONTINUED THE MAGICIAN IS THE LEFT WING OF A YELLOW BUTTERFLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-113 THAT COLOR CAN ONLY BE FOUND IN THE YELLOW COUNTRY OF THE WINKIES WEST OF THE EMERALD CITY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-114 I'LL FIND IT DECLARED OJO. IS THAT ALL?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-115 OH NO,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-116 I'LL GET MY BOOK OF RECIPES AND SEE WHAT COMES NEXT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-117 SAYING THIS THE MAGICIAN UNLOCKED A DRAWER OF HIS CABINET AND DREW OUT A SMALL BOOK COVERED WITH BLUE LEATHER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-118 LOOKING THROUGH THE PAGES HE FOUND THE RECIPE HE WANTED AND SAID, I MUST HAVE A GILL OF WATER FROM A DARK WELL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-119 WHAT KIND OF A WELL IS THAT SIR?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-120 ASKED THE BOY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-121 ONE WHERE THE LIGHT OF DAY NEVER PENETRATES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-122 THE WATER MUST BE PUT IN A GOLD BOTTLE AND BROUGHT TO ME WITHOUT ANY LIGHT EVER REACHING IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-123 I'LL GET THE WATER FROM THE DARK WELL SAID OJO. THEN I MUST HAVE THREE HAIRS FROM THE TIP OF A WOOZY'S TAIL AND A DROP OF OIL FROM A LIVE MAN'S BODY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-124 OJO LOOKED GRAVE AT THIS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-125 WHAT IS A WOOZY PLEASE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-126 HE INQUIRED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-127 SOME SORT OF AN ANIMAL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-128 I'VE NEVER SEEN ONE SO I CAN'T DESCRIBE IT REPLIED THE MAGICIAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-129 IF I CAN FIND A WOOZY I'LL GET THE HAIRS FROM ITS TAIL SAID OJO. BUT IS THERE EVER ANY OIL IN A MAN'S BODY?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-130 THE MAGICIAN LOOKED IN THE BOOK AGAIN TO MAKE SURE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-131 THAT'S WHAT THE RECIPE CALLS FOR HE REPLIED AND OF COURSE WE MUST GET EVERYTHING THAT IS CALLED FOR OR THE CHARM WON'T WORK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-132 THE BOOK DOESN'T SAY BLOOD',
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-133 IT SAYS OIL AND THERE MUST BE OIL SOMEWHERE IN A LIVE MAN'S BODY OR THE BOOK WOULDN'T ASK FOR IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-134 ALL RIGHT RETURNED OJO TRYING NOT TO FEEL DISCOURAGED,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-135 I'LL TRY TO FIND IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-136 THE MAGICIAN LOOKED AT THE LITTLE MUNCHKIN BOY IN A DOUBTFUL WAY AND SAID, ALL THIS WILL MEAN A LONG JOURNEY FOR YOU,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-137 PERHAPS SEVERAL LONG JOURNEYS,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-138 FOR YOU MUST SEARCH THROUGH SEVERAL OF THE DIFFERENT COUNTRIES OF OZ IN ORDER TO GET THE THINGS I NEED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-139 I KNOW IT SIR,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-140 BUT I MUST DO MY BEST TO SAVE UNC NUNKIE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-141 AND ALSO MY POOR WIFE MARGOLOTTE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-142 IF YOU SAVE ONE YOU WILL SAVE THE OTHER FOR BOTH STAND THERE TOGETHER AND THE SAME COMPOUND WILL RESTORE THEM BOTH TO LIFE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-143 DO THE BEST YOU CAN OJO AND WHILE YOU ARE GONE I SHALL BEGIN THE SIX YEARS JOB OF MAKING A NEW BATCH OF THE POWDER OF LIFE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-144 THEN IF YOU SHOULD UNLUCKILY FAIL TO SECURE ANY ONE OF THE THINGS NEEDED I WILL HAVE LOST NO TIME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-145 BUT IF YOU SUCCEED YOU MUST RETURN HERE AS QUICKLY AS YOU CAN AND THAT WILL SAVE ME MUCH TIRESOME STIRRING OF FOUR KETTLES WITH BOTH FEET AND BOTH HANDS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-146 I WILL START ON MY JOURNEY AT ONCE SIR SAID THE BOY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-147 AND I WILL GO WITH YOU DECLARED THE PATCHWORK GIRL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-148 NO NO!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-149 EXCLAIMED THE MAGICIAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-150 YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO LEAVE THIS HOUSE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-151 YOU ARE ONLY A SERVANT AND HAVE NOT BEEN DISCHARGED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-152 SCRAPS WHO HAD BEEN DANCING UP AND DOWN THE ROOM STOPPED AND LOOKED AT HIM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-153 WHAT IS A SERVANT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-154 SHE ASKED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-155 ONE WHO SERVES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-156 A A SORT OF SLAVE HE EXPLAINED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-157 VERY WELL SAID THE PATCHWORK GIRL I'M GOING TO SERVE YOU AND YOUR WIFE BY HELPING OJO FIND THE THINGS YOU NEED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-158 YOU NEED A LOT YOU KNOW SUCH AS ARE NOT EASILY FOUND.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-159 IT IS TRUE SIGHED DOCTOR PIPT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-160 I AM WELL AWARE THAT OJO HAS UNDERTAKEN A SERIOUS TASK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-161 SCRAPS LAUGHED AND RESUMING HER DANCE SHE SAID, HERE'S A JOB FOR A BOY OF BRAINS, A DROP OF OIL FROM A LIVE MAN'S VEINS,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-162 A SIX LEAVED CLOVER,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-163 THREE NICE HAIRS FROM A WOOZY'S TAIL THE BOOK DECLARES ARE NEEDED FOR THE MAGIC SPELL AND WATER FROM A PITCH DARK WELL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-164 THE YELLOW WING OF A BUTTERFLY TO FIND MUST OJO ALSO TRY AND IF HE GETS THEM WITHOUT HARM DOC PIPT WILL MAKE THE MAGIC CHARM,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-165 BUT IF HE DOESN'T GET EM UNC WILL ALWAYS STAND A MARBLE CHUNK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-166 THE MAGICIAN LOOKED AT HER THOUGHTFULLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-167 POOR MARGOLOTTE MUST HAVE GIVEN YOU SOME OF THE QUALITY OF POESY BY MISTAKE HE SAID.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-168 AND IF THAT IS TRUE I DIDN'T MAKE A VERY GOOD ARTICLE WHEN I PREPARED IT OR ELSE YOU GOT AN OVERDOSE OR AN UNDERDOSE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-169 HOWEVER I BELIEVE I SHALL LET YOU GO WITH OJO FOR MY POOR WIFE WILL NOT NEED YOUR SERVICES UNTIL SHE IS RESTORED TO LIFE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-170 ALSO I THINK YOU MAY BE ABLE TO HELP THE BOY FOR YOUR HEAD SEEMS TO CONTAIN SOME THOUGHTS I DID NOT EXPECT TO FIND IN IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-171 BUT BE VERY CAREFUL OF YOURSELF FOR YOU'RE A SOUVENIR OF MY DEAR MARGOLOTTE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-172 TRY NOT TO GET RIPPED OR YOUR STUFFING MAY FALL OUT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-173 ONE OF YOUR EYES SEEMS LOOSE AND YOU MAY HAVE TO SEW IT ON TIGHTER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-174 IF YOU TALK TOO MUCH YOU'LL WEAR OUT YOUR SCARLET PLUSH TONGUE WHICH OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN HEMMED ON THE EDGES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-175 AND REMEMBER YOU BELONG TO ME AND MUST RETURN HERE AS SOON AS YOUR MISSION IS ACCOMPLISHED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-176 I'M GOING WITH SCRAPS AND OJO ANNOUNCED THE GLASS CAT. YOU CAN'T SAID THE MAGICIAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-177 WHY NOT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-178 YOU'D GET BROKEN IN NO TIME AND YOU COULDN'T BE A BIT OF USE TO THE BOY AND THE PATCHWORK GIRL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-179 I BEG TO DIFFER WITH YOU RETURNED THE CAT IN A HAUGHTY TONE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-180 THREE HEADS ARE BETTER THAN TWO AND MY PINK BRAINS ARE BEAUTIFUL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-181 YOU CAN SEE EM WORK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-182 WELL GO ALONG SAID THE MAGICIAN IRRITABLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-183 YOU'RE ONLY AN ANNOYANCE ANYHOW AND I'M GLAD TO GET RID OF YOU.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-184 THANK YOU FOR NOTHING THEN ANSWERED THE CAT STIFFLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-185 DOCTOR PIPT TOOK A SMALL BASKET FROM A CUPBOARD AND PACKED SEVERAL THINGS IN IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-186 THEN HE HANDED IT TO OJO. HERE IS SOME FOOD AND A BUNDLE OF CHARMS HE SAID.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-187 IT IS ALL I CAN GIVE YOU BUT I AM SURE YOU WILL FIND FRIENDS ON YOUR JOURNEY WHO WILL ASSIST YOU IN YOUR SEARCH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-188 TAKE CARE OF THE PATCHWORK GIRL AND BRING HER SAFELY BACK FOR SHE OUGHT TO PROVE USEFUL TO MY WIFE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-189 AS FOR THE GLASS CAT PROPERLY NAMED BUNGLE IF SHE BOTHERS YOU I NOW GIVE YOU MY PERMISSION TO BREAK HER IN TWO FOR SHE IS NOT RESPECTFUL AND DOES NOT OBEY ME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-190 I MADE A MISTAKE IN GIVING HER THE PINK BRAINS YOU SEE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-191 THEN OJO WENT TO UNC NUNKIE AND KISSED THE OLD MAN'S MARBLE FACE VERY TENDERLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-192 I'M GOING TO TRY TO SAVE YOU UNC HE SAID JUST AS IF THE MARBLE IMAGE COULD HEAR HIM,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-193 AND THEN HE SHOOK THE CROOKED HAND OF THE CROOKED MAGICIAN WHO WAS ALREADY BUSY HANGING THE FOUR KETTLES IN THE FIREPLACE AND PICKING UP HIS BASKET LEFT THE HOUSE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-05-194 THE PATCHWORK GIRL FOLLOWED HIM AND AFTER THEM CAME THE GLASS CAT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-01 CHAPTER SIX THE JOURNEY OJO HAD NEVER TRAVELED BEFORE AND SO HE ONLY KNEW THAT THE PATH DOWN THE MOUNTAINSIDE LED INTO THE OPEN MUNCHKIN COUNTRY WHERE LARGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE DWELT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-02 SCRAPS WAS QUITE NEW AND NOT SUPPOSED TO KNOW ANYTHING OF THE LAND OF OZ WHILE THE GLASS CAT ADMITTED SHE HAD NEVER WANDERED VERY FAR AWAY FROM THE MAGICIAN'S HOUSE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-03 THERE WAS ONLY ONE PATH BEFORE THEM AT THE BEGINNING SO THEY COULD NOT MISS THEIR WAY AND FOR A TIME THEY WALKED THROUGH THE THICK FOREST IN SILENT THOUGHT EACH ONE IMPRESSED WITH THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ADVENTURE THEY HAD UNDERTAKEN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-04 SUDDENLY THE PATCHWORK GIRL LAUGHED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-05 IT WAS FUNNY TO SEE HER LAUGH BECAUSE HER CHEEKS WRINKLED UP HER NOSE TIPPED HER SILVER BUTTON EYES TWINKLED AND HER MOUTH CURLED AT THE CORNERS IN A COMICAL WAY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-06 HAS SOMETHING PLEASED YOU?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-07 ASKED OJO WHO WAS FEELING SOLEMN AND JOYLESS THROUGH THINKING UPON HIS UNCLE'S SAD FATE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-08 YES SHE ANSWERED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-09 YOUR WORLD PLEASES ME FOR IT'S A QUEER WORLD AND LIFE IN IT IS QUEERER STILL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-10 HERE AM I MADE FROM AN OLD BEDQUILT AND INTENDED TO BE A SLAVE TO MARGOLOTTE RENDERED FREE AS AIR BY AN ACCIDENT THAT NONE OF YOU COULD FORESEE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-11 I AM ENJOYING LIFE AND SEEING THE WORLD WHILE THE WOMAN WHO MADE ME IS STANDING HELPLESS AS A BLOCK OF WOOD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-12 IF THAT ISN'T FUNNY ENOUGH TO LAUGH AT I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-13 YOU'RE NOT SEEING MUCH OF THE WORLD YET MY POOR INNOCENT SCRAPS REMARKED THE CAT. THE WORLD DOESN'T CONSIST WHOLLY OF THE TREES THAT ARE ON ALL SIDES OF US.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-14 THEY PRETTY TREES?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-15 RETURNED SCRAPS BOBBING HER HEAD UNTIL HER BROWN YARN CURLS FLUTTERED IN THE BREEZE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-16 GROWING BETWEEN THEM I CAN SEE LOVELY FERNS AND WILD FLOWERS AND SOFT GREEN MOSSES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-17 IF THE REST OF YOUR WORLD IS HALF AS BEAUTIFUL I SHALL BE GLAD I'M ALIVE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-18 I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE REST OF THE WORLD IS LIKE I'M SURE SAID THE CAT,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-19 BUT I MEAN TO FIND OUT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-20 I HAVE NEVER BEEN OUT OF THE FOREST OJO ADDED,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-21 BUT TO ME THE TREES ARE GLOOMY AND SAD AND THE WILD FLOWERS SEEM LONESOME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-22 IT MUST BE NICER WHERE THERE ARE NO TREES AND THERE IS ROOM FOR LOTS OF PEOPLE TO LIVE TOGETHER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-23 I WONDER IF ANY OF THE PEOPLE WE SHALL MEET WILL BE AS SPLENDID AS I AM SAID THE PATCHWORK GIRL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-24 ALL I HAVE SEEN SO FAR HAVE PALE COLORLESS SKINS AND CLOTHES AS BLUE AS THE COUNTRY THEY LIVE IN WHILE I AM OF MANY GORGEOUS COLORS FACE AND BODY AND CLOTHES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-25 THAT IS WHY I AM BRIGHT AND CONTENTED OJO WHILE YOU ARE BLUE AND SAD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-26 I THINK I MADE A MISTAKE IN GIVING YOU SO MANY SORTS OF BRAINS OBSERVED THE BOY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-27 PERHAPS AS THE MAGICIAN SAID YOU HAVE AN OVERDOSE AND THEY MAY NOT AGREE WITH YOU.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-28 WHAT HAD YOU TO DO WITH MY BRAINS?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-29 ASKED SCRAPS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-30 A LOT REPLIED OJO. OLD MARGOLOTTE MEANT TO GIVE YOU ONLY A FEW JUST ENOUGH TO KEEP YOU GOING BUT WHEN SHE WASN'T LOOKING I ADDED A GOOD MANY MORE OF THE BEST KINDS I COULD FIND IN THE MAGICIAN'S CUPBOARD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-31 THANKS SAID THE GIRL DANCING ALONG THE PATH AHEAD OF OJO AND THEN DANCING BACK TO HIS SIDE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-32 IF A FEW BRAINS ARE GOOD MANY BRAINS MUST BE BETTER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-33 BUT THEY OUGHT TO BE EVENLY BALANCED SAID THE BOY AND I HAD NO TIME TO BE CAREFUL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-34 FROM THE WAY YOU'RE ACTING I GUESS THE DOSE WAS BADLY MIXED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-35 SCRAPS HASN'T ENOUGH BRAINS TO HURT HER SO DON'T WORRY REMARKED THE CAT WHICH WAS TROTTING ALONG IN A VERY DAINTY AND GRACEFUL MANNER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-36 THE ONLY BRAINS WORTH CONSIDERING ARE MINE WHICH ARE PINK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-37 YOU CAN SEE EM WORK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-38 AFTER WALKING A LONG TIME THEY CAME TO A LITTLE BROOK THAT TRICKLED ACROSS THE PATH AND HERE OJO SAT DOWN TO REST AND EAT SOMETHING FROM HIS BASKET.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-39 HE FOUND THAT THE MAGICIAN HAD GIVEN HIM PART OF A LOAF OF BREAD AND A SLICE OF CHEESE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-40 HE BROKE OFF SOME OF THE BREAD AND WAS SURPRISED TO FIND THE LOAF JUST AS LARGE AS IT WAS BEFORE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-41 IT WAS THE SAME WAY WITH THE CHEESE, HOWEVER MUCH HE BROKE OFF FROM THE SLICE IT REMAINED EXACTLY THE SAME SIZE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-42 AH SAID HE NODDING WISELY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-43 THAT'S MAGIC.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-44 DOCTOR PIPT HAS ENCHANTED THE BREAD AND THE CHEESE SO IT WILL LAST ME ALL THROUGH MY JOURNEY HOWEVER MUCH I EAT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-45 WHY DO YOU PUT THOSE THINGS INTO YOUR MOUTH?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-46 ASKED SCRAPS GAZING AT HIM IN ASTONISHMENT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-47 DO YOU NEED MORE STUFFING?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-48 THEN WHY DON'T YOU USE COTTON SUCH AS I AM STUFFED WITH?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-49 I DON'T NEED THAT KIND SAID OJO. BUT A MOUTH IS TO TALK WITH ISN'T IT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-50 IT IS ALSO TO EAT WITH REPLIED THE BOY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-51 IF I DIDN'T PUT FOOD INTO MY MOUTH AND EAT IT I WOULD GET HUNGRY AND STARVE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-52 AH I DIDN'T KNOW THAT SHE SAID.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-53 GIVE ME SOME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-54 OJO HANDED HER A BIT OF THE BREAD AND SHE PUT IT IN HER MOUTH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-55 WHAT NEXT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-56 SHE ASKED SCARCELY ABLE TO SPEAK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-57 CHEW IT AND SWALLOW IT SAID THE BOY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-58 SCRAPS TRIED THAT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-59 HER PEARL TEETH WERE UNABLE TO CHEW THE BREAD AND BEYOND HER MOUTH THERE WAS NO OPENING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-60 BEING UNABLE TO SWALLOW SHE THREW AWAY THE BREAD AND LAUGHED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-61 I MUST GET HUNGRY AND STARVE FOR I CAN'T EAT SHE SAID.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-62 NEITHER CAN I ANNOUNCED THE CAT,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-63 BUT I'M NOT FOOL ENOUGH TO TRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-64 CAN'T YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND I ARE SUPERIOR PEOPLE AND NOT MADE LIKE THESE POOR HUMANS?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-65 WHY SHOULD I UNDERSTAND THAT OR ANYTHING ELSE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-66 ASKED THE GIRL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-67 DON'T BOTHER MY HEAD BY ASKING CONUNDRUMS I BEG OF YOU.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-68 JUST LET ME DISCOVER MYSELF IN MY OWN WAY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-69 WITH THIS SHE BEGAN AMUSING HERSELF BY LEAPING ACROSS THE BROOK AND BACK AGAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-70 BE CAREFUL OR YOU'LL FALL IN THE WATER WARNED OJO. NEVER MIND.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-71 YOU'D BETTER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-72 IF YOU GET WET YOU'LL BE SOGGY AND CAN'T WALK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-73 YOUR COLORS MIGHT RUN TOO HE SAID.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-74 DON'T MY COLORS RUN WHENEVER I RUN?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-75 SHE ASKED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-76 NOT IN THE WAY I MEAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-77 IF THEY GET WET THE REDS AND GREENS AND YELLOWS AND PURPLES OF YOUR PATCHES MIGHT RUN INTO EACH OTHER AND BECOME JUST A BLUR NO COLOR AT ALL YOU KNOW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-78 THEN SAID THE PATCHWORK GIRL I'LL BE CAREFUL FOR IF I SPOILED MY SPLENDID COLORS I WOULD CEASE TO BE BEAUTIFUL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-79 PAH!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-80 SNEERED THE GLASS CAT SUCH COLORS ARE NOT BEAUTIFUL,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-81 THEY'RE UGLY AND IN BAD TASTE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-82 PLEASE NOTICE THAT MY BODY HAS NO COLOR AT ALL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-83 I'M TRANSPARENT EXCEPT FOR MY EXQUISITE RED HEART AND MY LOVELY PINK BRAINS YOU CAN SEE EM WORK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-84 SHOO SHOO SHOO!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-85 CRIED SCRAPS DANCING AROUND AND LAUGHING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-86 AND YOUR HORRID GREEN EYES MISS BUNGLE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-87 YOU CAN'T SEE YOUR EYES BUT WE CAN AND I NOTICE YOU'RE VERY PROUD OF WHAT LITTLE COLOR YOU HAVE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-88 SHOO MISS BUNGLE SHOO SHOO SHOO!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-89 IF YOU WERE ALL COLORS AND MANY COLORS AS I AM YOU'D BE TOO STUCK UP FOR ANYTHING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-90 SHE LEAPED OVER THE CAT AND BACK AGAIN AND THE STARTLED BUNGLE CREPT CLOSE TO A TREE TO ESCAPE HER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-91 THIS MADE SCRAPS LAUGH MORE HEARTILY THAN EVER AND SHE SAID, WHOOP TE DOODLE DOO!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-92 THE CAT HAS LOST HER SHOE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-93 HER TOOTSIE'S BARE BUT SHE DON'T CARE SO WHAT'S THE ODDS TO YOU?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-94 DEAR ME OJO SAID THE CAT,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-95 DON'T YOU THINK THE CREATURE IS A LITTLE BIT CRAZY?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-96 IT MAY BE HE ANSWERED WITH A PUZZLED LOOK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-97 IF SHE CONTINUES HER INSULTS I'LL SCRATCH OFF HER SUSPENDER BUTTON EYES DECLARED THE CAT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-98 DON'T QUARREL PLEASE PLEADED THE BOY RISING TO RESUME THE JOURNEY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-99 LET US BE GOOD COMRADES AND AS HAPPY AND CHEERFUL AS POSSIBLE FOR WE ARE LIKELY TO MEET WITH PLENTY OF TROUBLE ON OUR WAY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-100 IT WAS NEARLY SUNDOWN WHEN THEY CAME TO THE EDGE OF THE FOREST AND SAW SPREAD OUT BEFORE THEM A DELIGHTFUL LANDSCAPE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-101 THERE WERE BROAD BLUE FIELDS STRETCHING FOR MILES OVER THE VALLEY WHICH WAS DOTTED EVERYWHERE WITH PRETTY BLUE DOMED HOUSES NONE OF WHICH HOWEVER WAS VERY NEAR TO THE PLACE WHERE THEY STOOD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-102 JUST AT THE POINT WHERE THE PATH LEFT THE FOREST STOOD A TINY HOUSE COVERED WITH LEAVES FROM THE TREES AND BEFORE THIS STOOD A MUNCHKIN MAN WITH AN AXE IN HIS HAND.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-103 HE SEEMED VERY MUCH SURPRISED WHEN OJO AND SCRAPS AND THE GLASS CAT CAME OUT OF THE WOODS BUT AS THE PATCHWORK GIRL APPROACHED NEARER HE SAT DOWN UPON A BENCH AND LAUGHED SO HARD THAT HE COULD NOT SPEAK FOR A LONG TIME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-104 THIS MAN WAS A WOODCHOPPER AND LIVED ALL ALONE IN THE LITTLE HOUSE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-105 HE HAD BUSHY BLUE WHISKERS AND MERRY BLUE EYES AND HIS BLUE CLOTHES WERE QUITE OLD AND WORN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-106 MERCY ME!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-107 THE WOODCHOPPER WHEN AT LAST HE COULD STOP LAUGHING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-108 WHO WOULD THINK SUCH A FUNNY HARLEQUIN LIVED IN THE LAND OF OZ?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-109 WHERE DID YOU COME FROM CRAZY QUILT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-110 DO YOU MEAN ME?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-111 ASKED THE PATCHWORK GIRL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-112 OF COURSE HE REPLIED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-113 YOU MISJUDGE MY ANCESTRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-114 I'M NOT A CRAZY QUILT,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-115 I'M PATCHWORK SHE SAID.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-116 THERE'S NO DIFFERENCE HE REPLIED BEGINNING TO LAUGH AGAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-117 WHEN MY OLD GRANDMOTHER SEWS SUCH THINGS TOGETHER SHE CALLS IT A CRAZY QUILT,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-118 BUT I NEVER THOUGHT SUCH A JUMBLE COULD COME TO LIFE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-119 IT WAS THE MAGIC POWDER THAT DID IT EXPLAINED OJO. OH THEN YOU HAVE COME FROM THE CROOKED MAGICIAN ON THE MOUNTAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-120 I MIGHT HAVE KNOWN IT FOR WELL I DECLARE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-121 HERE'S A GLASS CAT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-122 BUT THE MAGICIAN WILL GET IN TROUBLE FOR THIS,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-123 IT'S AGAINST THE LAW FOR ANYONE TO WORK MAGIC EXCEPT GLINDA THE GOOD AND THE ROYAL WIZARD OF OZ. IF YOU PEOPLE OR THINGS OR GLASS SPECTACLES OR CRAZY QUILTS OR WHATEVER YOU ARE GO NEAR THE EMERALD CITY YOU'LL BE ARRESTED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-124 WE'RE GOING THERE ANYHOW DECLARED SCRAPS SITTING UPON THE BENCH AND SWINGING HER STUFFED LEGS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-125 IF ANY OF US TAKES A REST WE'LL BE ARRESTED SURE AND GET NO RESTITUTION CAUSE THE REST WE MUST ENDURE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-126 I SEE SAID THE WOODCHOPPER NODDING,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-127 YOU'RE AS CRAZY AS THE CRAZY QUILT YOU'RE MADE OF.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-128 FOR MY PART I'M MADE OF PURE GLASS EXCEPT MY JEWEL HEART AND MY PRETTY PINK BRAINS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-129 DID YOU NOTICE MY BRAINS STRANGER?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-130 YOU CAN SEE EM WORK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-131 SO I CAN REPLIED THE WOODCHOPPER,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-132 BUT I CAN'T SEE THAT THEY ACCOMPLISH MUCH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-133 A GLASS CAT IS A USELESS SORT OF THING BUT A PATCHWORK GIRL IS REALLY USEFUL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-134 SHE MAKES ME LAUGH AND LAUGHTER IS THE BEST THING IN LIFE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-135 THERE WAS ONCE A WOODCHOPPER A FRIEND OF MINE WHO WAS MADE ALL OF TIN AND I USED TO LAUGH EVERY TIME I SAW HIM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-136 A TIN WOODCHOPPER?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-137 SAID OJO. THAT IS STRANGE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-138 MY FRIEND WASN'T ALWAYS TIN SAID THE MAN BUT HE WAS CARELESS WITH HIS AXE AND USED TO CHOP HIMSELF VERY BADLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-139 WHENEVER HE LOST AN ARM OR A LEG HE HAD IT REPLACED WITH TIN,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-140 SO AFTER A WHILE HE WAS ALL TIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-141 AND COULD HE CHOP WOOD THEN?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-142 ASKED THE BOY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-143 HE COULD IF HE DIDN'T RUST HIS TIN JOINTS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-144 BUT ONE DAY HE MET DOROTHY IN THE FOREST AND WENT WITH HER TO THE EMERALD CITY WHERE HE MADE HIS FORTUNE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-145 HE IS NOW ONE OF THE FAVORITES OF PRINCESS OZMA AND SHE HAS MADE HIM THE EMPEROR OF THE WINKIES THE COUNTRY WHERE ALL IS YELLOW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-146 WHO IS DOROTHY?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-147 INQUIRED THE PATCHWORK GIRL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-148 A LITTLE MAID WHO USED TO LIVE IN KANSAS BUT IS NOW A PRINCESS OF OZ. SHE'S OZMA'S BEST FRIEND THEY SAY AND LIVES WITH HER IN THE ROYAL PALACE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-149 IS DOROTHY MADE OF TIN?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-150 INQUIRED OJO. IS SHE PATCHWORK LIKE ME?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-151 INQUIRED SCRAPS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-152 NO SAID THE MAN,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-153 DOROTHY IS FLESH JUST AS I AM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-154 I KNOW OF ONLY ONE TIN PERSON AND THAT IS NICK CHOPPER THE TIN WOODMAN,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-155 AND THERE WILL NEVER BE BUT ONE PATCHWORK GIRL FOR ANY MAGICIAN THAT SEES YOU WILL REFUSE TO MAKE ANOTHER ONE LIKE YOU.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-156 I SUPPOSE WE SHALL SEE THE TIN WOODMAN FOR WE ARE GOING TO THE COUNTRY OF THE WINKIES SAID THE BOY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-157 WHAT FOR?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-158 ASKED THE WOODCHOPPER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-159 TO GET THE LEFT WING OF A YELLOW BUTTERFLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-160 IT IS A LONG JOURNEY DECLARED THE MAN AND YOU WILL GO THROUGH LONELY PARTS OF OZ AND CROSS RIVERS AND TRAVERSE DARK FORESTS BEFORE YOU GET THERE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-161 SUITS ME ALL RIGHT SAID SCRAPS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-162 I'LL GET A CHANCE TO SEE THE COUNTRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-163 YOU'RE CRAZY GIRL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-164 BETTER CRAWL INTO A RAG BAG AND HIDE THERE,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-165 OR GIVE YOURSELF TO SOME LITTLE GIRL TO PLAY WITH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-166 THOSE WHO TRAVEL ARE LIKELY TO MEET TROUBLE,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-167 THAT'S WHY I STAY AT HOME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-168 THE WOODCHOPPER THEN INVITED THEM ALL TO STAY THE NIGHT AT HIS LITTLE HUT BUT THEY WERE ANXIOUS TO GET ON AND SO LEFT HIM AND CONTINUED ALONG THE PATH WHICH WAS BROADER NOW AND MORE DISTINCT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-169 THEY EXPECTED TO REACH SOME OTHER HOUSE BEFORE IT GREW DARK BUT THE TWILIGHT WAS BRIEF AND OJO SOON BEGAN TO FEAR THEY HAD MADE A MISTAKE IN LEAVING THE WOODCHOPPER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-170 I CAN SCARCELY SEE THE PATH HE SAID AT LAST.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-171 CAN YOU SEE IT SCRAPS?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-172 NO REPLIED THE PATCHWORK GIRL WHO WAS HOLDING FAST TO THE BOY'S ARM SO HE COULD GUIDE HER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-173 I CAN SEE DECLARED THE GLASS CAT. MY EYES ARE BETTER THAN YOURS AND MY PINK BRAINS NEVER MIND YOUR PINK BRAINS PLEASE SAID OJO HASTILY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-174 JUST RUN AHEAD AND SHOW US THE WAY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-175 WAIT A MINUTE AND I'LL TIE A STRING TO YOU,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-176 FOR THEN YOU CAN LEAD US.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-177 HE GOT A STRING FROM HIS POCKET AND TIED IT AROUND THE CAT'S NECK AND AFTER THAT THE CREATURE GUIDED THEM ALONG THE PATH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-178 THEY HAD PROCEEDED IN THIS WAY FOR ABOUT AN HOUR WHEN A TWINKLING BLUE LIGHT APPEARED AHEAD OF THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-179 GOOD!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-180 THERE'S A HOUSE AT LAST CRIED OJO. WHEN WE REACH IT THE GOOD PEOPLE WILL SURELY WELCOME US AND GIVE US A NIGHT'S LODGING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-181 BUT HOWEVER FAR THEY WALKED THE LIGHT SEEMED TO GET NO NEARER SO BY AND BY THE CAT STOPPED SHORT SAYING, I THINK THE LIGHT IS TRAVELING TOO AND WE SHALL NEVER BE ABLE TO CATCH UP WITH IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-182 BUT HERE IS A HOUSE BY THE ROADSIDE SO WHY GO FARTHER?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-183 WHERE IS THE HOUSE BUNGLE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-184 JUST HERE BESIDE US SCRAPS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-185 OJO WAS NOW ABLE TO SEE A SMALL HOUSE NEAR THE PATHWAY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-186 IT WAS DARK AND SILENT BUT THE BOY WAS TIRED AND WANTED TO REST SO HE WENT UP TO THE DOOR AND KNOCKED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-187 WHO IS THERE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-188 CRIED A VOICE FROM WITHIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-189 I AM OJO THE UNLUCKY AND WITH ME ARE MISS SCRAPS PATCHWORK AND THE GLASS CAT HE REPLIED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-190 WHAT DO YOU WANT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-191 ASKED THE VOICE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-192 A PLACE TO SLEEP SAID OJO. COME IN THEN,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-193 BUT DON'T MAKE ANY NOISE AND YOU MUST GO DIRECTLY TO BED RETURNED THE VOICE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-194 OJO UNLATCHED THE DOOR AND ENTERED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-195 IT WAS VERY DARK INSIDE AND HE COULD SEE NOTHING AT ALL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-196 BUT THE CAT EXCLAIMED, WHY THERE'S NO ONE HERE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-197 THERE MUST BE SAID THE BOY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-198 SOME ONE SPOKE TO ME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-199 I CAN SEE EVERYTHING IN THE ROOM REPLIED THE CAT AND NO ONE IS PRESENT BUT OURSELVES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-200 BUT HERE ARE THREE BEDS ALL MADE UP SO WE MAY AS WELL GO TO SLEEP.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-201 WHAT IS SLEEP?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-202 INQUIRED THE PATCHWORK GIRL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-203 IT'S WHAT YOU DO WHEN YOU GO TO BED SAID OJO. BUT WHY DO YOU GO TO BED?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-204 PERSISTED THE PATCHWORK GIRL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-205 HERE HERE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-206 YOU ARE MAKING ALTOGETHER TOO MUCH NOISE CRIED THE VOICE THEY HAD HEARD BEFORE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-207 KEEP QUIET STRANGERS AND GO TO BED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-208 THE CAT WHICH COULD SEE IN THE DARK LOOKED SHARPLY AROUND FOR THE OWNER OF THE VOICE BUT COULD DISCOVER NO ONE ALTHOUGH THE VOICE HAD SEEMED CLOSE BESIDE THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-209 SHE ARCHED HER BACK A LITTLE AND SEEMED AFRAID.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-210 THEN SHE WHISPERED TO OJO, COME!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-211 AND LED HIM TO A BED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-212 WITH HIS HANDS THE BOY FELT OF THE BED AND FOUND IT WAS BIG AND SOFT WITH FEATHER PILLOWS AND PLENTY OF BLANKETS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-213 SO HE TOOK OFF HIS SHOES AND HAT AND CREPT INTO THE BED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-214 THEN THE CAT LED SCRAPS TO ANOTHER BED AND THE PATCHWORK GIRL WAS PUZZLED TO KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-215 LIE DOWN AND KEEP QUIET WHISPERED THE CAT WARNINGLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-216 CAN'T I SING?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-217 ASKED SCRAPS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-218 NO. CAN'T I WHISTLE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-219 ASKED SCRAPS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-220 NO. CAN'T I DANCE TILL MORNING IF I WANT TO?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-221 ASKED SCRAPS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-222 YOU MUST KEEP QUIET SAID THE CAT IN A SOFT VOICE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-223 I DON'T WANT TO REPLIED THE PATCHWORK GIRL SPEAKING AS LOUDLY AS USUAL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-224 WHAT RIGHT HAVE YOU TO ORDER ME AROUND?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-225 IF I WANT TO TALK OR YELL OR WHISTLE BEFORE SHE COULD SAY ANYTHING MORE AN UNSEEN HAND SEIZED HER FIRMLY AND THREW HER OUT OF THE DOOR WHICH CLOSED BEHIND HER WITH A SHARP SLAM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-226 SHE FOUND HERSELF BUMPING AND ROLLING IN THE ROAD AND WHEN SHE GOT UP AND TRIED TO OPEN THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE AGAIN SHE FOUND IT LOCKED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-227 WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO SCRAPS?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-228 ASKED OJO. NEVER MIND.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-06-229 LET'S GO TO SLEEP OR SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN TO US ANSWERED THE GLASS CAT. SO OJO SNUGGLED DOWN IN HIS BED AND FELL ASLEEP AND HE WAS SO TIRED THAT HE NEVER WAKENED UNTIL BROAD DAYLIGHT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-01 CHAPTER SEVEN THE TROUBLESOME PHONOGRAPH WHEN THE BOY OPENED HIS EYES NEXT MORNING HE LOOKED CAREFULLY AROUND THE ROOM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-02 THESE SMALL MUNCHKIN HOUSES SELDOM HAD MORE THAN ONE ROOM IN THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-03 THAT IN WHICH OJO NOW FOUND HIMSELF HAD THREE BEDS SET ALL IN A ROW ON ONE SIDE OF IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-04 THE GLASS CAT LAY ASLEEP ON ONE BED OJO WAS IN THE SECOND AND THE THIRD WAS NEATLY MADE UP AND SMOOTHED FOR THE DAY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-05 ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM WAS A ROUND TABLE ON WHICH BREAKFAST WAS ALREADY PLACED SMOKING HOT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-06 ONLY ONE CHAIR WAS DRAWN UP TO THE TABLE WHERE A PLACE WAS SET FOR ONE PERSON.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-07 NO ONE SEEMED TO BE IN THE ROOM EXCEPT THE BOY AND BUNGLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-08 OJO GOT UP AND PUT ON HIS SHOES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-09 FINDING A TOILET STAND AT THE HEAD OF HIS BED HE WASHED HIS FACE AND HANDS AND BRUSHED HIS HAIR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-10 THEN HE WENT TO THE TABLE AND SAID, I WONDER IF THIS IS MY BREAKFAST?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-11 EAT IT!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-12 COMMANDED A VOICE AT HIS SIDE SO NEAR THAT OJO JUMPED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-13 BUT NO PERSON COULD HE SEE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-14 HE WAS HUNGRY AND THE BREAKFAST LOOKED GOOD,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-15 SO HE SAT DOWN AND ATE ALL HE WANTED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-16 THEN RISING HE TOOK HIS HAT AND WAKENED THE GLASS CAT. COME ON BUNGLE SAID HE,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-17 WE MUST GO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-18 HE CAST ANOTHER GLANCE ABOUT THE ROOM AND SPEAKING TO THE AIR HE SAID, WHOEVER LIVES HERE HAS BEEN KIND TO ME AND I'M MUCH OBLIGED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-19 THERE WAS NO ANSWER SO HE TOOK HIS BASKET AND WENT OUT THE DOOR THE CAT FOLLOWING HIM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-20 IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PATH SAT THE PATCHWORK GIRL PLAYING WITH PEBBLES SHE HAD PICKED UP.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-21 OH THERE YOU ARE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-22 SHE EXCLAIMED CHEERFULLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-23 I THOUGHT YOU WERE NEVER COMING OUT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-24 IT HAS BEEN DAYLIGHT A LONG TIME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-25 WHAT DID YOU DO ALL NIGHT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-26 ASKED THE BOY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-27 SAT HERE AND WATCHED THE STARS AND THE MOON SHE REPLIED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-28 THEY'RE INTERESTING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-29 I NEVER SAW THEM BEFORE YOU KNOW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-30 OF COURSE NOT SAID OJO. YOU WERE CRAZY TO ACT SO BADLY AND GET THROWN OUTDOORS REMARKED BUNGLE AS THEY RENEWED THEIR JOURNEY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-31 THAT'S ALL RIGHT SAID SCRAPS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-32 IF I HADN'T BEEN THROWN OUT I WOULDN'T HAVE SEEN THE STARS NOR THE BIG GRAY WOLF.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-33 OJO. THE ONE THAT CAME TO THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE THREE TIMES DURING THE NIGHT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-34 I DON'T SEE WHY THAT SHOULD BE SAID THE BOY THOUGHTFULLY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-35 THERE WAS PLENTY TO EAT IN THAT HOUSE FOR I HAD A FINE BREAKFAST AND I SLEPT IN A NICE BED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-36 DON'T YOU FEEL TIRED?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-37 THE PATCHWORK GIRL NOTICING THAT THE BOY YAWNED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-38 WHY YES,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-39 I'M AS TIRED AS I WAS LAST NIGHT,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-40 AND YET I SLEPT VERY WELL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-41 AND AREN'T YOU HUNGRY?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-42 IT'S STRANGE REPLIED OJO. I HAD A GOOD BREAKFAST AND YET I THINK I'LL NOW EAT SOME OF MY CRACKERS AND CHEESE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-43 SCRAPS DANCED UP AND DOWN THE PATH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-44 THEN SHE SANG, KIZZLE KAZZLE KORE,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-45 THE WOLF IS AT THE DOOR THERE'S NOTHING TO EAT BUT A BONE WITHOUT MEAT AND A BILL FROM THE GROCERY STORE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-46 WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-47 ASKED OJO. DON'T ASK ME REPLIED SCRAPS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-48 I SAY WHAT COMES INTO MY HEAD BUT OF COURSE I KNOW NOTHING OF A GROCERY STORE OR BONES WITHOUT MEAT OR VERY MUCH ELSE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-49 NO SAID THE CAT,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-50 SHE'S STARK STARING RAVING CRAZY AND HER BRAINS CAN'T BE PINK FOR THEY DON'T WORK PROPERLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-51 BOTHER THE BRAINS!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-52 CRIED SCRAPS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-53 WHO CARES FOR EM ANYHOW?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-54 HAVE YOU NOTICED HOW BEAUTIFUL MY PATCHES ARE IN THIS SUNLIGHT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-55 JUST THEN THEY HEARD A SOUND AS OF FOOTSTEPS PATTERING ALONG THE PATH BEHIND THEM AND ALL THREE TURNED TO SEE WHAT WAS COMING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-56 TO THEIR ASTONISHMENT THEY BEHELD A SMALL ROUND TABLE RUNNING AS FAST AS ITS FOUR SPINDLE LEGS COULD CARRY IT AND TO THE TOP WAS SCREWED FAST A PHONOGRAPH WITH A BIG GOLD HORN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-57 HOLD ON!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-58 SHOUTED THE PHONOGRAPH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-59 WAIT FOR ME!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-60 GOODNESS ME,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-61 IT'S THAT MUSIC THING WHICH THE CROOKED MAGICIAN SCATTERED THE POWDER OF LIFE OVER SAID OJO. SO IT IS RETURNED BUNGLE IN A GRUMPY TONE OF VOICE,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-62 AND THEN AS THE PHONOGRAPH OVERTOOK THEM THE GLASS CAT ADDED STERNLY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE ANYHOW?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-63 I'VE RUN AWAY SAID THE MUSIC THING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-64 AFTER YOU LEFT OLD DOCTOR PIPT AND I HAD A DREADFUL QUARREL AND HE THREATENED TO SMASH ME TO PIECES IF I DIDN'T KEEP QUIET.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-65 OF COURSE I WOULDN'T DO THAT BECAUSE A TALKING MACHINE IS SUPPOSED TO TALK AND MAKE A NOISE AND SOMETIMES MUSIC.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-66 SO I SLIPPED OUT OF THE HOUSE WHILE THE MAGICIAN WAS STIRRING HIS FOUR KETTLES AND I'VE BEEN RUNNING AFTER YOU ALL NIGHT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-67 NOW THAT I'VE FOUND SUCH PLEASANT COMPANY I CAN TALK AND PLAY TUNES ALL I WANT TO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-68 OJO WAS GREATLY ANNOYED BY THIS UNWELCOME ADDITION TO THEIR PARTY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-69 AT FIRST HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO THE NEWCOMER BUT A LITTLE THOUGHT DECIDED HIM NOT TO MAKE FRIENDS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-70 WE ARE TRAVELING ON IMPORTANT BUSINESS HE DECLARED AND YOU'LL EXCUSE ME IF I SAY WE CAN'T BE BOTHERED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-71 HOW VERY IMPOLITE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-72 EXCLAIMED THE PHONOGRAPH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-73 I'M SORRY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-74 BUT IT'S TRUE SAID THE BOY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-75 YOU'LL HAVE TO GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-76 THIS IS VERY UNKIND TREATMENT I MUST SAY WHINED THE PHONOGRAPH IN AN INJURED TONE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-77 EVERYONE SEEMS TO HATE ME AND YET I WAS INTENDED TO AMUSE PEOPLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-78 IT ISN'T YOU WE HATE ESPECIALLY OBSERVED THE GLASS CAT,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-79 IT'S YOUR DREADFUL MUSIC.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-80 WHEN I LIVED IN THE SAME ROOM WITH YOU I WAS MUCH ANNOYED BY YOUR SQUEAKY HORN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-81 IT GROWLS AND GRUMBLES AND CLICKS AND SCRATCHES SO IT SPOILS THE MUSIC AND YOUR MACHINERY RUMBLES SO THAT THE RACKET DROWNS EVERY TUNE YOU ATTEMPT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-82 THAT ISN'T MY FAULT,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-83 THE FAULT OF MY RECORDS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-84 I MUST ADMIT THAT I HAVEN'T A CLEAR RECORD ANSWERED THE MACHINE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-85 JUST THE SAME YOU'LL HAVE TO GO AWAY SAID OJO. WAIT A MINUTE CRIED SCRAPS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-86 THIS MUSIC THING INTERESTS ME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-87 I REMEMBER TO HAVE HEARD MUSIC WHEN I FIRST CAME TO LIFE AND I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR IT AGAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-88 WHAT IS YOUR NAME MY POOR ABUSED PHONOGRAPH?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-89 VICTOR COLUMBIA EDISON IT ANSWERED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-90 WELL I SHALL CALL YOU VIC FOR SHORT SAID THE PATCHWORK GIRL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-91 GO AHEAD AND PLAY SOMETHING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-92 IT'LL DRIVE YOU CRAZY WARNED THE CAT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-93 I'M CRAZY NOW ACCORDING TO YOUR STATEMENT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-94 LOOSEN UP AND REEL OUT THE MUSIC VIC. THE ONLY RECORD I HAVE WITH ME EXPLAINED THE PHONOGRAPH IS ONE THE MAGICIAN ATTACHED JUST BEFORE WE HAD OUR QUARREL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-95 IT'S A HIGHLY CLASSICAL COMPOSITION.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-96 A WHAT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-97 SCRAPS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-98 IT IS CLASSICAL MUSIC AND IS CONSIDERED THE BEST AND MOST PUZZLING EVER MANUFACTURED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-99 YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO LIKE IT WHETHER YOU DO OR NOT AND IF YOU DON'T THE PROPER THING IS TO LOOK AS IF YOU DID.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-100 UNDERSTAND?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-101 NOT IN THE LEAST SAID SCRAPS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-102 THEN LISTEN!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-103 AT ONCE THE MACHINE BEGAN TO PLAY AND IN A FEW MINUTES OJO PUT HIS HANDS TO HIS EARS TO SHUT OUT THE SOUNDS AND THE CAT SNARLED AND SCRAPS BEGAN TO LAUGH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-104 CUT IT OUT VIC SHE SAID.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-105 THAT'S ENOUGH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-106 BUT THE PHONOGRAPH CONTINUED PLAYING THE DREARY TUNE SO OJO SEIZED THE CRANK JERKED IT FREE AND THREW IT INTO THE ROAD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-107 HOWEVER THE MOMENT THE CRANK STRUCK THE GROUND IT BOUNDED BACK TO THE MACHINE AGAIN AND BEGAN WINDING IT UP.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-108 AND STILL THE MUSIC PLAYED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-109 LET'S RUN!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-110 CRIED SCRAPS AND THEY ALL STARTED AND RAN DOWN THE PATH AS FAST AS THEY COULD GO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-111 BUT THE PHONOGRAPH WAS RIGHT BEHIND THEM AND COULD RUN AND PLAY AT THE SAME TIME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-112 IT CALLED OUT REPROACHFULLY, WHAT'S THE MATTER?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-113 DON'T YOU LOVE CLASSICAL MUSIC?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-114 NO VIC SAID SCRAPS HALTING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-115 WE WILL PASSICAL THE CLASSICAL AND PRESERVE WHAT JOY WE HAVE LEFT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-116 I HAVEN'T ANY NERVES THANK GOODNESS BUT YOUR MUSIC MAKES MY COTTON SHRINK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-117 THEN TURN OVER MY RECORD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-118 THERE'S A RAG TIME TUNE ON THE OTHER SIDE SAID THE MACHINE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-119 WHAT'S RAG TIME?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-120 THE OPPOSITE OF CLASSICAL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-121 ALL RIGHT SAID SCRAPS AND TURNED OVER THE RECORD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-122 THE PHONOGRAPH NOW BEGAN TO PLAY A JERKY JUMBLE OF SOUNDS WHICH PROVED SO BEWILDERING THAT AFTER A MOMENT SCRAPS STUFFED HER PATCHWORK APRON INTO THE GOLD HORN AND CRIED, STOP STOP!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-123 THAT'S THE OTHER EXTREME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-124 IT'S EXTREMELY BAD!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-125 MUFFLED AS IT WAS THE PHONOGRAPH PLAYED ON.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-126 IF YOU DON'T SHUT OFF THAT MUSIC I'LL SMASH YOUR RECORD THREATENED OJO. THE MUSIC STOPPED AT THAT AND THE MACHINE TURNED ITS HORN FROM ONE TO ANOTHER AND SAID WITH GREAT INDIGNATION, WHAT'S THE MATTER NOW?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-127 IS IT POSSIBLE YOU CAN'T APPRECIATE RAG TIME?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-128 SCRAPS OUGHT TO BEING RAGS HERSELF SAID THE CAT,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-129 BUT I SIMPLY CAN'T STAND IT,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-130 IT MAKES MY WHISKERS CURL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-131 IT IS INDEED DREADFUL!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-132 EXCLAIMED OJO WITH A SHUDDER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-133 IT'S ENOUGH TO DRIVE A CRAZY LADY MAD MURMURED THE PATCHWORK GIRL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-134 I'LL TELL YOU WHAT VIC SHE ADDED AS SHE SMOOTHED OUT HER APRON AND PUT IT ON AGAIN FOR SOME REASON OR OTHER YOU'VE MISSED YOUR GUESS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-135 YOU'RE NOT A CONCERT,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-136 YOU'RE A NUISANCE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-137 MUSIC HATH CHARMS TO SOOTHE THE SAVAGE BREAST ASSERTED THE PHONOGRAPH SADLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-138 THEN WE'RE NOT SAVAGES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-139 I ADVISE YOU TO GO HOME AND BEG THE MAGICIAN'S PARDON.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-140 NEVER!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-141 HE'D SMASH ME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-142 THAT'S WHAT WE SHALL DO IF YOU STAY HERE OJO DECLARED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-143 RUN ALONG VIC AND BOTHER SOME ONE ELSE ADVISED SCRAPS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-144 FIND SOME ONE WHO IS REAL WICKED AND STAY WITH HIM TILL HE REPENTS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-145 IN THAT WAY YOU CAN DO SOME GOOD IN THE WORLD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-146 THE MUSIC THING TURNED SILENTLY AWAY AND TROTTED DOWN A SIDE PATH TOWARD A DISTANT MUNCHKIN VILLAGE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-147 IS THAT THE WAY WE GO?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-148 ASKED BUNGLE ANXIOUSLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-149 NO SAID OJO,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-150 I THINK WE SHALL KEEP STRAIGHT AHEAD FOR THIS PATH IS THE WIDEST AND BEST.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-07-151 WHEN WE COME TO SOME HOUSE WE WILL INQUIRE THE WAY TO THE EMERALD CITY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-01 CHAPTER EIGHT THE FOOLISH OWL AND THE WISE DONKEY ON THEY WENT AND HALF AN HOUR'S STEADY WALKING BROUGHT THEM TO A HOUSE SOMEWHAT BETTER THAN THE TWO THEY HAD ALREADY PASSED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-02 IT STOOD CLOSE TO THE ROADSIDE AND OVER THE DOOR WAS A SIGN THAT READ, MISS FOOLISH OWL AND MISTER WISE DONKEY, PUBLIC ADVISERS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-03 WHEN OJO READ THIS SIGN ALOUD SCRAPS SAID LAUGHINGLY, WELL HERE IS A PLACE TO GET ALL THE ADVICE WE WANT MAYBE MORE THAN WE NEED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-04 LET'S GO IN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-05 THE BOY KNOCKED AT THE DOOR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-06 COME IN!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-07 CALLED A DEEP BASS VOICE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-08 SO THEY OPENED THE DOOR AND ENTERED THE HOUSE WHERE A LITTLE LIGHT BROWN DONKEY DRESSED IN A BLUE APRON AND A BLUE CAP WAS ENGAGED IN DUSTING THE FURNITURE WITH A BLUE CLOTH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-09 ON A SHELF OVER THE WINDOW SAT A GREAT BLUE OWL WITH A BLUE SUNBONNET ON HER HEAD BLINKING HER BIG ROUND EYES AT THE VISITORS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-10 GOOD MORNING SAID THE DONKEY IN HIS DEEP VOICE WHICH SEEMED BIGGER THAN HE WAS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-11 DID YOU COME TO US FOR ADVICE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-12 WHY WE CAME ANYHOW REPLIED SCRAPS AND NOW WE ARE HERE WE MAY AS WELL HAVE SOME ADVICE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-13 IT'S FREE ISN'T IT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-14 CERTAINLY SAID THE DONKEY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-15 ADVICE DOESN'T COST ANYTHING UNLESS YOU FOLLOW IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-16 PERMIT ME TO SAY BY THE WAY THAT YOU ARE THE QUEEREST LOT OF TRAVELERS THAT EVER CAME TO MY SHOP.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-17 JUDGING YOU MERELY BY APPEARANCES I THINK YOU'D BETTER TALK TO THE FOOLISH OWL YONDER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-18 THEY TURNED TO LOOK AT THE BIRD WHICH FLUTTERED ITS WINGS AND STARED BACK AT THEM WITH ITS BIG EYES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-19 HOOT TI TOOT TI TOOT!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-20 CRIED THE OWL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-21 FIDDLE CUM FOO HOWDY DO?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-22 RIDDLE CUM TIDDLE CUM TOO RA LA LOO!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-23 THAT BEATS YOUR POETRY SCRAPS SAID OJO. IT'S JUST NONSENSE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-24 DECLARED THE GLASS CAT. BUT IT'S GOOD ADVICE FOR THE FOOLISH SAID THE DONKEY ADMIRINGLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-25 LISTEN TO MY PARTNER AND YOU CAN'T GO WRONG.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-26 SAID THE OWL IN A GRUMBLING VOICE, PATCHWORK GIRL HAS COME TO LIFE,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-27 NO ONE'S SWEETHEART NO ONE'S WIFE,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-28 LACKING SENSE AND LOVING FUN SHE'LL BE SNUBBED BY EVERYONE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-29 QUITE A COMPLIMENT!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-30 QUITE A COMPLIMENT I DECLARE EXCLAIMED THE DONKEY TURNING TO LOOK AT SCRAPS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-31 YOU ARE CERTAINLY A WONDER MY DEAR AND I FANCY YOU'D MAKE A SPLENDID PINCUSHION.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-32 IF YOU BELONGED TO ME I'D WEAR SMOKED GLASSES WHEN I LOOKED AT YOU.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-33 WHY?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-34 ASKED THE PATCHWORK GIRL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-35 BECAUSE YOU ARE SO GAY AND GAUDY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-36 IT IS MY BEAUTY THAT DAZZLES YOU SHE ASSERTED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-37 YOU MUNCHKIN PEOPLE ALL STRUT AROUND IN YOUR STUPID BLUE COLOR WHILE I YOU ARE WRONG IN CALLING ME A MUNCHKIN INTERRUPTED THE DONKEY FOR I WAS BORN IN THE LAND OF MO AND CAME TO VISIT THE LAND OF OZ ON THE DAY IT WAS SHUT OFF FROM ALL THE REST OF THE WORLD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-38 SO HERE I AM OBLIGED TO STAY AND I CONFESS IT IS A VERY PLEASANT COUNTRY TO LIVE IN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-39 HOOT TI TOOT!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-40 CRIED THE OWL,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-41 OJO'S SEARCHING FOR A CHARM CAUSE UNC NUNKIE'S COME TO HARM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-42 CHARMS ARE SCARCE,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-43 THEY'RE HARD TO GET,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-44 OJO'S GOT A JOB YOU BET!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-45 IS THE OWL SO VERY FOOLISH?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-46 ASKED THE BOY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-47 EXTREMELY SO REPLIED THE DONKEY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-48 NOTICE WHAT VULGAR EXPRESSIONS SHE USES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-49 BUT I ADMIRE THE OWL FOR THE REASON THAT SHE IS POSITIVELY FOOLISH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-50 OWLS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE SO VERY WISE GENERALLY THAT A FOOLISH ONE IS UNUSUAL AND YOU PERHAPS KNOW THAT ANYTHING OR ANYONE UNUSUAL IS SURE TO BE INTERESTING TO THE WISE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-51 THE OWL FLAPPED ITS WINGS AGAIN MUTTERING THESE WORDS, IT'S HARD TO BE A GLASSY CAT NO CAT CAN BE MORE HARD THAN THAT,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-52 SHE'S SO TRANSPARENT EVERY ACT IS CLEAR TO US AND THAT'S A FACT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-53 HAVE YOU NOTICED MY PINK BRAINS?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-54 BUNGLE PROUDLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-55 YOU CAN SEE EM WORK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-56 NOT IN THE DAYTIME SAID THE DONKEY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-57 SHE CAN'T SEE VERY WELL BY DAY POOR THING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-58 BUT HER ADVICE IS EXCELLENT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-59 I ADVISE YOU ALL TO FOLLOW IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-60 THE OWL HASN'T GIVEN US ANY ADVICE AS YET THE BOY DECLARED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-61 NO?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-62 THEN WHAT DO YOU CALL ALL THOSE SWEET POEMS?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-63 JUST FOOLISHNESS REPLIED OJO. SCRAPS DOES THE SAME THING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-64 FOOLISHNESS!

l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-72 WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO GET TO THE EMERALD CITY?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-73 ASKED OJO. WALK SAID THE DONKEY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-74 I KNOW,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-75 BUT WHAT ROAD SHALL I TAKE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-76 WAS THE BOY'S NEXT QUESTION.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-77 THE ROAD OF YELLOW BRICKS OF COURSE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-78 IT LEADS DIRECTLY TO THE EMERALD CITY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-79 AND HOW SHALL WE FIND THE ROAD OF YELLOW BRICKS?

l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-82 THANK YOU SAID THE BOY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-83 AT LAST YOU HAVE TOLD ME SOMETHING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-84 IS THAT THE EXTENT OF YOUR WISDOM?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-85 ASKED SCRAPS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-86 NO REPLIED THE DONKEY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-87 I KNOW MANY OTHER THINGS BUT THEY WOULDN'T INTEREST YOU.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-88 SO I'LL GIVE YOU A LAST WORD OF ADVICE, MOVE ON FOR THE SOONER YOU DO THAT THE SOONER YOU'LL GET TO THE EMERALD CITY OF OZ. HOOT TI TOOT TI TOOT TI TOO!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-89 SCREECHED THE OWL,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-90 OFF YOU GO!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-91 FAST OR SLOW WHERE YOU'RE GOING YOU DON'T KNOW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-92 PATCHES BUNGLE MUNCHKIN LAD FACING FORTUNES GOOD AND BAD MEETING DANGERS GRAVE AND SAD SOMETIMES WORRIED SOMETIMES GLAD WHERE YOU'RE GOING YOU DON'T KNOW NOR DO I BUT OFF YOU GO!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-93 SOUNDS LIKE A HINT TO ME SAID THE PATCHWORK GIRL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-08-94 THEN LET'S TAKE IT AND GO REPLIED OJO. THEY SAID GOOD BYE TO THE WISE DONKEY AND THE FOOLISH OWL AND AT ONCE RESUMED THEIR JOURNEY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-01 CHAPTER NINE THEY MEET THE WOOZY THERE SEEM TO BE VERY FEW HOUSES AROUND HERE AFTER ALL REMARKED OJO AFTER THEY HAD WALKED FOR A TIME IN SILENCE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-02 NEVER MIND SAID SCRAPS,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-03 WE ARE NOT LOOKING FOR HOUSES BUT RATHER THE ROAD OF YELLOW BRICKS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-04 WON'T IT BE FUNNY TO RUN ACROSS SOMETHING YELLOW IN THIS DISMAL BLUE COUNTRY?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-05 THERE ARE WORSE COLORS THAN YELLOW IN THIS COUNTRY ASSERTED THE GLASS CAT IN A SPITEFUL TONE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-06 OH,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-07 DO YOU MEAN THE PINK PEBBLES YOU CALL YOUR BRAINS AND YOUR RED HEART AND GREEN EYES?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-08 ASKED THE PATCHWORK GIRL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-09 NO,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-10 I MEAN YOU IF YOU MUST KNOW IT GROWLED THE CAT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-11 YOU'RE JEALOUS!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-12 LAUGHED SCRAPS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-13 YOU'D GIVE YOUR WHISKERS FOR A LOVELY VARIEGATED COMPLEXION LIKE MINE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-14 I WOULDN'T!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-15 RETORTED THE CAT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-16 I'VE THE CLEAREST COMPLEXION IN THE WORLD AND I DON'T EMPLOY A BEAUTY DOCTOR EITHER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-17 I SEE YOU DON'T SAID SCRAPS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-18 PLEASE DON'T QUARREL BEGGED OJO. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT JOURNEY AND QUARRELING MAKES ME DISCOURAGED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-19 TO BE BRAVE ONE MUST BE CHEERFUL SO I HOPE YOU WILL BE AS GOOD TEMPERED AS POSSIBLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-20 THEY HAD TRAVELED SOME DISTANCE WHEN SUDDENLY THEY FACED A HIGH FENCE WHICH BARRED ANY FURTHER PROGRESS STRAIGHT AHEAD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-21 IT RAN DIRECTLY ACROSS THE ROAD AND ENCLOSED A SMALL FOREST OF TALL TREES SET CLOSE TOGETHER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-22 WHEN THE GROUP OF ADVENTURERS PEERED THROUGH THE BARS OF THE FENCE THEY THOUGHT THIS FOREST LOOKED MORE GLOOMY AND FORBIDDING THAN ANY THEY HAD EVER SEEN BEFORE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-23 THEY SOON DISCOVERED THAT THE PATH THEY HAD BEEN FOLLOWING NOW MADE A BEND AND PASSED AROUND THE ENCLOSURE BUT WHAT MADE OJO STOP AND LOOK THOUGHTFUL WAS A SIGN PAINTED ON THE FENCE WHICH READ, BEWARE OF THE WOOZY!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-24 THAT MEANS HE SAID THAT THERE'S A WOOZY INSIDE THAT FENCE AND THE WOOZY MUST BE A DANGEROUS ANIMAL OR THEY WOULDN'T TELL PEOPLE TO BEWARE OF IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-25 LET'S KEEP OUT THEN REPLIED SCRAPS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-26 THAT PATH IS OUTSIDE THE FENCE AND MISTER WOOZY MAY HAVE ALL HIS LITTLE FOREST TO HIMSELF FOR ALL WE CARE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-27 BUT ONE OF OUR ERRANDS IS TO FIND A WOOZY OJO EXPLAINED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-28 THE MAGICIAN WANTS ME TO GET THREE HAIRS FROM THE END OF A WOOZY'S TAIL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-29 LET'S GO ON AND FIND SOME OTHER WOOZY SUGGESTED THE CAT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-30 THIS ONE IS UGLY AND DANGEROUS OR THEY WOULDN'T CAGE HIM UP.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-31 MAYBE WE SHALL FIND ANOTHER THAT IS TAME AND GENTLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-32 PERHAPS THERE ISN'T ANY OTHER AT ALL ANSWERED OJO. THE SIGN DOESN'T SAY, BEWARE A WOOZY',
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-33 IT SAYS, BEWARE THE WOOZY WHICH MAY MEAN THERE'S ONLY ONE IN ALL THE LAND OF OZ. THEN SAID SCRAPS SUPPOSE WE GO IN AND FIND HIM?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-34 VERY LIKELY IF WE ASK HIM POLITELY TO LET US PULL THREE HAIRS OUT OF THE TIP OF HIS TAIL HE WON'T HURT US.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-35 IT WOULD HURT HIM I'M SURE AND THAT WOULD MAKE HIM CROSS SAID THE CAT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-36 YOU NEEDN'T WORRY BUNGLE REMARKED THE PATCHWORK GIRL,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-37 FOR IF THERE IS DANGER YOU CAN CLIMB A TREE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-38 OJO AND I ARE NOT AFRAID,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-39 ARE WE OJO?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-40 I AM A LITTLE THE BOY ADMITTED,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-41 HOW SHALL WE GET OVER THE FENCE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-42 CLIMB ANSWERED SCRAPS AND AT ONCE SHE BEGAN CLIMBING UP THE ROWS OF BARS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-43 OJO FOLLOWED AND FOUND IT MORE EASY THAN HE HAD EXPECTED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-44 WHEN THEY GOT TO THE TOP OF THE FENCE THEY BEGAN TO GET DOWN ON THE OTHER SIDE AND SOON WERE IN THE FOREST.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-45 THE GLASS CAT BEING SMALL CREPT BETWEEN THE LOWER BARS AND JOINED THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-46 HERE THERE WAS NO PATH OF ANY SORT SO THEY ENTERED THE WOODS THE BOY LEADING THE WAY AND WANDERED THROUGH THE TREES UNTIL THEY WERE NEARLY IN THE CENTER OF THE FOREST.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-47 THEY NOW CAME UPON A CLEAR SPACE IN WHICH STOOD A ROCKY CAVE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-48 SO FAR THEY HAD MET NO LIVING CREATURE BUT WHEN OJO SAW THE CAVE HE KNEW IT MUST BE THE DEN OF THE WOOZY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-49 IT IS HARD TO FACE ANY SAVAGE BEAST WITHOUT A SINKING OF THE HEART BUT STILL MORE TERRIFYING IS IT TO FACE AN UNKNOWN BEAST WHICH YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN EVEN A PICTURE OF.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-50 SO THERE IS LITTLE WONDER THAT THE PULSES OF THE MUNCHKIN BOY BEAT FAST AS HE AND HIS COMPANIONS STOOD FACING THE CAVE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-51 THE OPENING WAS PERFECTLY SQUARE AND ABOUT BIG ENOUGH TO ADMIT A GOAT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-52 I GUESS THE WOOZY IS ASLEEP SAID SCRAPS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-53 SHALL I THROW IN A STONE TO WAKEN HIM?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-54 NO,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-55 PLEASE DON'T ANSWERED OJO HIS VOICE TREMBLING A LITTLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-56 I'M IN NO HURRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-57 BUT HE HAD NOT LONG TO WAIT FOR THE WOOZY HEARD THE SOUND OF VOICES AND CAME TROTTING OUT OF HIS CAVE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-58 AS THIS IS THE ONLY WOOZY THAT HAS EVER LIVED EITHER IN THE LAND OF OZ OR OUT OF IT I MUST DESCRIBE IT TO YOU.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-59 THE CREATURE WAS ALL SQUARES AND FLAT SURFACES AND EDGES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-60 ITS HEAD WAS AN EXACT SQUARE LIKE ONE OF THE BUILDING BLOCKS A CHILD PLAYS WITH,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-61 THEREFORE IT HAD NO EARS BUT HEARD SOUNDS THROUGH TWO OPENINGS IN THE UPPER CORNERS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-62 ITS NOSE BEING IN THE CENTER OF A SQUARE SURFACE WAS FLAT WHILE THE MOUTH WAS FORMED BY THE OPENING OF THE LOWER EDGE OF THE BLOCK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-63 THE BODY OF THE WOOZY WAS MUCH LARGER THAN ITS HEAD BUT WAS LIKEWISE BLOCK SHAPED BEING TWICE AS LONG AS IT WAS WIDE AND HIGH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-64 THE TAIL WAS SQUARE AND STUBBY AND PERFECTLY STRAIGHT AND THE FOUR LEGS WERE MADE IN THE SAME WAY EACH BEING FOUR SIDED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-65 THE ANIMAL WAS COVERED WITH A THICK SMOOTH SKIN AND HAD NO HAIR AT ALL EXCEPT AT THE EXTREME END OF ITS TAIL WHERE THERE GREW EXACTLY THREE STIFF STUBBY HAIRS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-66 THE BEAST WAS DARK BLUE IN COLOR AND HIS FACE WAS NOT FIERCE NOR FEROCIOUS IN EXPRESSION BUT RATHER GOOD HUMORED AND DROLL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-67 SEEING THE STRANGERS THE WOOZY FOLDED HIS HIND LEGS AS IF THEY HAD BEEN HINGED AND SAT DOWN TO LOOK HIS VISITORS OVER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-68 WELL WELL HE EXCLAIMED,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-69 WHAT A QUEER LOT YOU ARE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-70 AT FIRST I THOUGHT SOME OF THOSE MISERABLE MUNCHKIN FARMERS HAD COME TO ANNOY ME BUT I AM RELIEVED TO FIND YOU IN THEIR STEAD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-71 IT IS PLAIN TO ME THAT YOU ARE A REMARKABLE GROUP AS REMARKABLE IN YOUR WAY AS I AM IN MINE AND SO YOU ARE WELCOME TO MY DOMAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-72 NICE PLACE ISN'T IT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-73 BUT LONESOME DREADFULLY LONESOME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-74 WHY DID THEY SHUT YOU UP HERE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-75 ASKED SCRAPS WHO WAS REGARDING THE QUEER SQUARE CREATURE WITH MUCH CURIOSITY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-76 BECAUSE I EAT UP ALL THE HONEY BEES WHICH THE MUNCHKIN FARMERS WHO LIVE AROUND HERE KEEP TO MAKE THEM HONEY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-77 ARE YOU FOND OF EATING HONEY BEES?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-78 THE BOY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-79 VERY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-80 THEY ARE REALLY DELICIOUS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-81 BUT THE FARMERS DID NOT LIKE TO LOSE THEIR BEES AND SO THEY TRIED TO DESTROY ME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-82 OF COURSE THEY COULDN'T DO THAT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-83 WHY NOT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-84 MY SKIN IS SO THICK AND TOUGH THAT NOTHING CAN GET THROUGH IT TO HURT ME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-85 SO FINDING THEY COULD NOT DESTROY ME THEY DROVE ME INTO THIS FOREST AND BUILT A FENCE AROUND ME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-86 UNKIND WASN'T IT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-87 BUT WHAT DO YOU EAT NOW?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-88 ASKED OJO. NOTHING AT ALL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-89 I'VE TRIED THE LEAVES FROM THE TREES AND THE MOSSES AND CREEPING VINES BUT THEY DON'T SEEM TO SUIT MY TASTE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-90 SO THERE BEING NO HONEY BEES HERE I'VE EATEN NOTHING FOR YEARS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-91 YOU MUST BE AWFULLY HUNGRY SAID THE BOY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-92 I'VE GOT SOME BREAD AND CHEESE IN MY BASKET.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-93 WOULD YOU LIKE THAT KIND OF FOOD?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-94 GIVE ME A NIBBLE AND I WILL TRY IT,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-95 THEN I CAN TELL YOU BETTER WHETHER IT IS GRATEFUL TO MY APPETITE RETURNED THE WOOZY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-96 SO THE BOY OPENED HIS BASKET AND BROKE A PIECE OFF THE LOAF OF BREAD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-97 HE TOSSED IT TOWARD THE WOOZY WHO CLEVERLY CAUGHT IT IN HIS MOUTH AND ATE IT IN A TWINKLING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-98 THAT'S RATHER GOOD DECLARED THE ANIMAL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-99 ANY MORE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-100 TRY SOME CHEESE SAID OJO AND THREW DOWN A PIECE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-101 THE WOOZY ATE THAT TOO AND SMACKED ITS LONG THIN LIPS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-102 THAT'S MIGHTY GOOD!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-103 IT EXCLAIMED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-104 ANY MORE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-105 PLENTY REPLIED OJO. SO HE SAT DOWN ON A STUMP AND FED THE WOOZY BREAD AND CHEESE FOR A LONG TIME,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-106 FOR NO MATTER HOW MUCH THE BOY BROKE OFF THE LOAF AND THE SLICE REMAINED JUST AS BIG.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-107 THAT'LL DO SAID THE WOOZY AT LAST,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-108 I'M QUITE FULL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-109 I HOPE THE STRANGE FOOD WON'T GIVE ME INDIGESTION.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-110 I HOPE NOT SAID OJO. IT'S WHAT I EAT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-111 WELL I MUST SAY I'M MUCH OBLIGED AND I'M GLAD YOU CAME ANNOUNCED THE BEAST.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-112 IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO IN RETURN FOR YOUR KINDNESS?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-113 YES SAID OJO EARNESTLY YOU HAVE IT IN YOUR POWER TO DO ME A GREAT FAVOR IF YOU WILL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-114 WHAT IS IT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-115 ASKED THE WOOZY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-116 NAME THE FAVOR AND I WILL GRANT IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-117 I I WANT THREE HAIRS FROM THE TIP OF YOUR TAIL SAID OJO WITH SOME HESITATION.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-118 THREE HAIRS!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-119 WHY THAT'S ALL I HAVE ON MY TAIL OR ANYWHERE ELSE EXCLAIMED THE BEAST.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-120 I KNOW,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-121 BUT I WANT THEM VERY MUCH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-122 THEY ARE MY SOLE ORNAMENTS MY PRETTIEST FEATURE SAID THE WOOZY UNEASILY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-123 IF I GIVE UP THOSE THREE HAIRS I I'M JUST A BLOCKHEAD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-124 YET I MUST HAVE THEM INSISTED THE BOY FIRMLY AND HE THEN TOLD THE WOOZY ALL ABOUT THE ACCIDENT TO UNC NUNKIE AND MARGOLOTTE AND HOW THE THREE HAIRS WERE TO BE A PART OF THE MAGIC CHARM THAT WOULD RESTORE THEM TO LIFE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-125 THE BEAST LISTENED WITH ATTENTION AND WHEN OJO HAD FINISHED THE RECITAL IT SAID WITH A SIGH, I ALWAYS KEEP MY WORD FOR I PRIDE MYSELF ON BEING SQUARE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-126 SO YOU MAY HAVE THE THREE HAIRS AND WELCOME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-127 I THINK UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES IT WOULD BE SELFISH IN ME TO REFUSE YOU.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-128 THANK YOU!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-129 THANK YOU VERY MUCH CRIED THE BOY JOYFULLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-130 MAY I PULL OUT THE HAIRS NOW?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-131 ANY TIME YOU LIKE ANSWERED THE WOOZY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-132 SO OJO WENT UP TO THE QUEER CREATURE AND TAKING HOLD OF ONE OF THE HAIRS BEGAN TO PULL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-133 HE PULLED HARDER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-134 HE PULLED WITH ALL HIS MIGHT,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-135 BUT THE HAIR REMAINED FAST.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-136 WHAT'S THE TROUBLE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-137 ASKED THE WOOZY WHICH OJO HAD DRAGGED HERE AND THERE ALL AROUND THE CLEARING IN HIS ENDEAVOR TO PULL OUT THE HAIR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-138 IT WON'T COME SAID THE BOY PANTING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-139 I WAS AFRAID OF THAT DECLARED THE BEAST.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-140 YOU'LL HAVE TO PULL HARDER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-141 I'LL HELP YOU EXCLAIMED SCRAPS COMING TO THE BOY'S SIDE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-142 YOU PULL THE HAIR AND I'LL PULL YOU AND TOGETHER WE OUGHT TO GET IT OUT EASILY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-143 WAIT A JIFFY CALLED THE WOOZY AND THEN IT WENT TO A TREE AND HUGGED IT WITH ITS FRONT PAWS SO THAT ITS BODY COULDN'T BE DRAGGED AROUND BY THE PULL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-144 ALL READY NOW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-145 GO AHEAD!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-146 OJO GRASPED THE HAIR WITH BOTH HANDS AND PULLED WITH ALL HIS STRENGTH WHILE SCRAPS SEIZED THE BOY AROUND HIS WAIST AND ADDED HER STRENGTH TO HIS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-147 BUT THE HAIR WOULDN'T BUDGE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-148 INSTEAD IT SLIPPED OUT OF OJO'S HANDS AND HE AND SCRAPS BOTH ROLLED UPON THE GROUND IN A HEAP AND NEVER STOPPED UNTIL THEY BUMPED AGAINST THE ROCKY CAVE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-149 GIVE IT UP ADVISED THE GLASS CAT AS THE BOY AROSE AND ASSISTED THE PATCHWORK GIRL TO HER FEET.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-150 A DOZEN STRONG MEN COULDN'T PULL OUT THOSE HAIRS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-151 I BELIEVE THEY'RE CLINCHED ON THE UNDER SIDE OF THE WOOZY'S THICK SKIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-152 THEN WHAT SHALL I DO?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-153 ASKED THE BOY DESPAIRINGLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-154 IF ON OUR RETURN I FAIL TO TAKE THESE THREE HAIRS TO THE CROOKED MAGICIAN THE OTHER THINGS I HAVE COME TO SEEK WILL BE OF NO USE AT ALL AND WE CANNOT RESTORE UNC NUNKIE AND MARGOLOTTE TO LIFE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-155 THEY'RE GONERS I GUESS SAID THE PATCHWORK GIRL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-156 NEVER MIND ADDED THE CAT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-157 I CAN'T SEE THAT OLD UNC AND MARGOLOTTE ARE WORTH ALL THIS TROUBLE ANYHOW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-158 BUT OJO DID NOT FEEL THAT WAY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-159 HE WAS SO DISHEARTENED THAT HE SAT DOWN UPON A STUMP AND BEGAN TO CRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-160 THE WOOZY LOOKED AT THE BOY THOUGHTFULLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-161 WHY DON'T YOU TAKE ME WITH YOU?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-162 ASKED THE BEAST.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-163 THEN WHEN AT LAST YOU GET TO THE MAGICIAN'S HOUSE HE CAN SURELY FIND SOME WAY TO PULL OUT THOSE THREE HAIRS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-164 OJO WAS OVERJOYED AT THIS SUGGESTION.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-165 THAT'S IT!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-166 HE CRIED WIPING AWAY THE TEARS AND SPRINGING TO HIS FEET WITH A SMILE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-167 IF I TAKE THE THREE HAIRS TO THE MAGICIAN IT WON'T MATTER IF THEY ARE STILL IN YOUR BODY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-168 IT CAN'T MATTER IN THE LEAST AGREED THE WOOZY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-169 COME ON THEN SAID THE BOY PICKING UP HIS BASKET,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-170 LET US START AT ONCE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-171 I HAVE SEVERAL OTHER THINGS TO FIND YOU KNOW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-172 BUT THE GLASS CAT GAVE A LITTLE LAUGH AND INQUIRED IN HER SCORNFUL WAY, HOW DO YOU INTEND TO GET THE BEAST OUT OF THIS FOREST?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-173 THAT PUZZLED THEM ALL FOR A TIME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-174 LET US GO TO THE FENCE AND THEN WE MAY FIND A WAY SUGGESTED SCRAPS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-175 SO THEY WALKED THROUGH THE FOREST TO THE FENCE REACHING IT AT A POINT EXACTLY OPPOSITE THAT WHERE THEY HAD ENTERED THE ENCLOSURE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-176 HOW DID YOU GET IN?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-177 ASKED THE WOOZY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-178 WE CLIMBED OVER ANSWERED OJO. I CAN'T DO THAT SAID THE BEAST.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-179 I'M A VERY SWIFT RUNNER FOR I CAN OVERTAKE A HONEY BEE AS IT FLIES,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-180 AND I CAN JUMP VERY HIGH WHICH IS THE REASON THEY MADE SUCH A TALL FENCE TO KEEP ME IN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-181 BUT I CAN'T CLIMB AT ALL AND I'M TOO BIG TO SQUEEZE BETWEEN THE BARS OF THE FENCE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-182 OJO TRIED TO THINK WHAT TO DO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-183 CAN YOU DIG?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-184 HE ASKED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-185 NO ANSWERED THE WOOZY FOR I HAVE NO CLAWS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-186 MY FEET ARE QUITE FLAT ON THE BOTTOM OF THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-187 NOR CAN I GNAW AWAY THE BOARDS AS I HAVE NO TEETH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-188 YOU'RE NOT SUCH A TERRIBLE CREATURE AFTER ALL REMARKED SCRAPS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-189 YOU HAVEN'T HEARD ME GROWL OR YOU WOULDN'T SAY THAT DECLARED THE WOOZY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-190 WHEN I GROWL THE SOUND ECHOES LIKE THUNDER ALL THROUGH THE VALLEYS AND WOODLANDS AND CHILDREN TREMBLE WITH FEAR AND WOMEN COVER THEIR HEADS WITH THEIR APRONS AND BIG MEN RUN AND HIDE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-191 I SUPPOSE THERE IS NOTHING IN THE WORLD SO TERRIBLE TO LISTEN TO AS THE GROWL OF A WOOZY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-192 PLEASE DON'T GROWL THEN BEGGED OJO EARNESTLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-193 THERE IS NO DANGER OF MY GROWLING FOR I AM NOT ANGRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-194 ONLY WHEN ANGRY DO I UTTER MY FEARFUL EAR SPLITTING SOUL SHUDDERING GROWL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-195 ALSO WHEN I AM ANGRY MY EYES FLASH FIRE WHETHER I GROWL OR NOT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-196 REAL FIRE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-197 ASKED OJO. OF COURSE REAL FIRE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-198 DO YOU SUPPOSE THEY'D FLASH IMITATION FIRE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-199 INQUIRED THE WOOZY IN AN INJURED TONE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-200 IN THAT CASE I'VE SOLVED THE RIDDLE CRIED SCRAPS DANCING WITH GLEE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-201 THOSE FENCE BOARDS ARE MADE OF WOOD AND IF THE WOOZY STANDS CLOSE TO THE FENCE AND LETS HIS EYES FLASH FIRE THEY MIGHT SET FIRE TO THE FENCE AND BURN IT UP.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-202 THEN HE COULD WALK AWAY WITH US EASILY BEING FREE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-203 AH I HAVE NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT PLAN OR I WOULD HAVE BEEN FREE LONG AGO SAID THE WOOZY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-204 BUT I CANNOT FLASH FIRE FROM MY EYES UNLESS I AM VERY ANGRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-205 CAN'T YOU GET ANGRY BOUT SOMETHING PLEASE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-206 ASKED OJO. I'LL TRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-207 YOU JUST SAY KRIZZLE KROO TO ME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-208 WILL THAT MAKE YOU ANGRY?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-209 INQUIRED THE BOY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-210 TERRIBLY ANGRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-211 WHAT DOES IT MEAN?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-212 ASKED SCRAPS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-213 I DON'T KNOW,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-214 THAT'S WHAT MAKES ME SO ANGRY REPLIED THE WOOZY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-215 HE THEN STOOD CLOSE TO THE FENCE WITH HIS HEAD NEAR ONE OF THE BOARDS AND SCRAPS CALLED OUT KRIZZLE KROO!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-216 THEN OJO SAID KRIZZLE KROO!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-217 AND THE GLASS CAT SAID KRIZZLE KROO!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-218 THE WOOZY BEGAN TO TREMBLE WITH ANGER AND SMALL SPARKS DARTED FROM HIS EYES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-219 TOGETHER AND THAT MADE THE BEAST'S EYES FLASH FIRE SO FIERCELY THAT THE FENCE BOARD CAUGHT THE SPARKS AND BEGAN TO SMOKE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-220 THEN IT BURST INTO FLAME AND THE WOOZY STEPPED BACK AND SAID TRIUMPHANTLY, AHA!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-221 THAT DID THE BUSINESS ALL RIGHT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-222 IT WAS A HAPPY THOUGHT FOR YOU TO YELL ALL TOGETHER FOR THAT MADE ME AS ANGRY AS I HAVE EVER BEEN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-223 FINE SPARKS WEREN'T THEY?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-224 REG'LAR FIREWORKS REPLIED SCRAPS ADMIRINGLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-225 IN A FEW MOMENTS THE BOARD HAD BURNED TO A DISTANCE OF SEVERAL FEET LEAVING AN OPENING BIG ENOUGH FOR THEM ALL TO PASS THROUGH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-226 OJO BROKE SOME BRANCHES FROM A TREE AND WITH THEM WHIPPED THE FIRE UNTIL IT WAS EXTINGUISHED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-227 WE DON'T WANT TO BURN THE WHOLE FENCE DOWN SAID HE FOR THE FLAMES WOULD ATTRACT THE ATTENTION OF THE MUNCHKIN FARMERS WHO WOULD THEN COME AND CAPTURE THE WOOZY AGAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-228 I GUESS THEY'LL BE RATHER SURPRISED WHEN THEY FIND HE'S ESCAPED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-229 SO THEY WILL DECLARED THE WOOZY CHUCKLING GLEEFULLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-230 WHEN THEY FIND I'M GONE THE FARMERS WILL BE BADLY SCARED FOR THEY'LL EXPECT ME TO EAT UP THEIR HONEY BEES AS I DID BEFORE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-231 THAT REMINDS ME SAID THE BOY THAT YOU MUST PROMISE NOT TO EAT HONEY BEES WHILE YOU ARE IN OUR COMPANY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-232 NONE AT ALL?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-233 NOT A BEE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-234 YOU WOULD GET US ALL INTO TROUBLE AND WE CAN'T AFFORD TO HAVE ANY MORE TROUBLE THAN IS NECESSARY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-235 I'LL FEED YOU ALL THE BREAD AND CHEESE YOU WANT AND THAT MUST SATISFY YOU.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-236 ALL RIGHT,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-237 I'LL PROMISE SAID THE WOOZY CHEERFULLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-238 AND WHEN I PROMISE ANYTHING YOU CAN DEPEND ON IT CAUSE I'M SQUARE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-239 I DON'T SEE WHAT DIFFERENCE THAT MAKES OBSERVED THE PATCHWORK GIRL AS THEY FOUND THE PATH AND CONTINUED THEIR JOURNEY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-240 THE SHAPE DOESN'T MAKE A THING HONEST DOES IT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-241 OF COURSE IT DOES RETURNED THE WOOZY VERY DECIDEDLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-242 NO ONE COULD TRUST THAT CROOKED MAGICIAN FOR INSTANCE JUST BECAUSE HE IS CROOKED,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-243 BUT A SQUARE WOOZY COULDN'T DO ANYTHING CROOKED IF HE WANTED TO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-244 I AM NEITHER SQUARE NOR CROOKED SAID SCRAPS LOOKING DOWN AT HER PLUMP BODY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-245 NO,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-246 YOU'RE ROUND SO YOU'RE LIABLE TO DO ANYTHING ASSERTED THE WOOZY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-247 DO NOT BLAME ME MISS GORGEOUS IF I REGARD YOU WITH SUSPICION.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-248 MANY A SATIN RIBBON HAS A COTTON BACK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-249 SCRAPS DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THIS BUT SHE HAD AN UNEASY MISGIVING THAT SHE HAD A COTTON BACK HERSELF.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-09-250 IT WOULD SETTLE DOWN AT TIMES AND MAKE HER SQUAT AND DUMPY AND THEN SHE HAD TO ROLL HERSELF IN THE ROAD UNTIL HER BODY STRETCHED OUT AGAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-01 CHAPTER TEN SHAGGY MAN TO THE RESCUE THEY HAD NOT GONE VERY FAR BEFORE BUNGLE WHO HAD RUN ON AHEAD CAME BOUNDING BACK TO SAY THAT THE ROAD OF YELLOW BRICKS WAS JUST BEFORE THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-02 AT ONCE THEY HURRIED FORWARD TO SEE WHAT THIS FAMOUS ROAD LOOKED LIKE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-03 IT WAS A BROAD ROAD BUT NOT STRAIGHT FOR IT WANDERED OVER HILL AND DALE AND PICKED OUT THE EASIEST PLACES TO GO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-04 ALL ITS LENGTH AND BREADTH WAS PAVED WITH SMOOTH BRICKS OF A BRIGHT YELLOW COLOR SO IT WAS SMOOTH AND LEVEL EXCEPT IN A FEW PLACES WHERE THE BRICKS HAD CRUMBLED OR BEEN REMOVED LEAVING HOLES THAT MIGHT CAUSE THE UNWARY TO STUMBLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-05 I WONDER SAID OJO LOOKING UP AND DOWN THE ROAD WHICH WAY TO GO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-06 WHERE ARE YOU BOUND FOR?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-07 ASKED THE WOOZY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-08 THE EMERALD CITY HE REPLIED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-09 THEN GO WEST SAID THE WOOZY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-10 I KNOW THIS ROAD PRETTY WELL FOR I'VE CHASED MANY A HONEY BEE OVER IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-11 HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TO THE EMERALD CITY?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-12 ASKED SCRAPS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-13 NO. I AM VERY SHY BY NATURE AS YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED SO I HAVEN'T MINGLED MUCH IN SOCIETY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-14 ARE YOU AFRAID OF MEN?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-15 INQUIRED THE PATCHWORK GIRL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-16 ME?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-17 WITH MY HEART RENDING GROWL MY HORRIBLE SHUDDERFUL GROWL?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-18 I SHOULD SAY NOT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-19 I AM NOT AFRAID OF ANYTHING DECLARED THE WOOZY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-20 I WISH I COULD SAY THE SAME SIGHED OJO. I DON'T THINK WE NEED BE AFRAID WHEN WE GET TO THE EMERALD CITY FOR UNC NUNKIE HAS TOLD ME THAT OZMA OUR GIRL RULER IS VERY LOVELY AND KIND AND TRIES TO HELP EVERYONE WHO IS IN TROUBLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-21 BUT THEY SAY THERE ARE MANY DANGERS LURKING ON THE ROAD TO THE GREAT FAIRY CITY AND SO WE MUST BE VERY CAREFUL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-22 I HOPE NOTHING WILL BREAK ME SAID THE GLASS CAT IN A NERVOUS VOICE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-23 I'M A LITTLE BRITTLE YOU KNOW AND CAN'T STAND MANY HARD KNOCKS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-24 IF ANYTHING SHOULD FADE THE COLORS OF MY LOVELY PATCHES IT WOULD BREAK MY HEART SAID THE PATCHWORK GIRL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-25 I'M NOT SURE YOU HAVE A HEART OJO REMINDED HER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-26 THEN IT WOULD BREAK MY COTTON PERSISTED SCRAPS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-27 DO YOU THINK THEY ARE ALL FAST COLORS OJO?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-28 SHE ASKED ANXIOUSLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-29 THEY SEEM FAST ENOUGH WHEN YOU RUN HE REPLIED,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-30 AND THEN LOOKING AHEAD OF THEM HE EXCLAIMED, OH WHAT LOVELY TREES!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-31 THEY WERE CERTAINLY PRETTY TO LOOK UPON AND THE TRAVELERS HURRIED FORWARD TO OBSERVE THEM MORE CLOSELY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-32 WHY THEY ARE NOT TREES AT ALL SAID SCRAPS,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-33 THEY ARE JUST MONSTROUS PLANTS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-34 THAT IS WHAT THEY REALLY WERE, MASSES OF GREAT BROAD LEAVES WHICH ROSE FROM THE GROUND FAR INTO THE AIR UNTIL THEY TOWERED TWICE AS HIGH AS THE TOP OF THE PATCHWORK GIRL'S HEAD WHO WAS A LITTLE TALLER THAN OJO. THE PLANTS FORMED ROWS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ROAD AND FROM EACH PLANT ROSE A DOZEN OR MORE OF THE BIG BROAD LEAVES WHICH SWAYED CONTINUALLY FROM SIDE TO SIDE ALTHOUGH NO WIND WAS BLOWING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-35 BUT THE MOST CURIOUS THING ABOUT THE SWAYING LEAVES WAS THEIR COLOR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-36 THEY SEEMED TO HAVE A GENERAL GROUNDWORK OF BLUE BUT HERE AND THERE OTHER COLORS GLINTED AT TIMES THROUGH THE BLUE GORGEOUS YELLOWS TURNING TO PINK PURPLE ORANGE AND SCARLET MINGLED WITH MORE SOBER BROWNS AND GRAYS EACH APPEARING AS A BLOTCH OR STRIPE ANYWHERE ON A LEAF AND THEN DISAPPEARING TO BE REPLACED BY SOME OTHER COLOR OF A DIFFERENT SHAPE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-37 THE CHANGEFUL COLORING OF THE GREAT LEAVES WAS VERY BEAUTIFUL BUT IT WAS BEWILDERING AS WELL AND THE NOVELTY OF THE SCENE DREW OUR TRAVELERS CLOSE TO THE LINE OF PLANTS WHERE THEY STOOD WATCHING THEM WITH RAPT INTEREST.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-38 SUDDENLY A LEAF BENT LOWER THAN USUAL AND TOUCHED THE PATCHWORK GIRL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-39 SWIFTLY IT ENVELOPED HER IN ITS EMBRACE COVERING HER COMPLETELY IN ITS THICK FOLDS AND THEN IT SWAYED BACK UPON ITS STEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-40 WHY SHE'S GONE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-41 GASPED OJO IN AMAZEMENT AND LISTENING CAREFULLY HE THOUGHT HE COULD HEAR THE MUFFLED SCREAMS OF SCRAPS COMING FROM THE CENTER OF THE FOLDED LEAF.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-42 BUT BEFORE HE COULD THINK WHAT HE OUGHT TO DO TO SAVE HER ANOTHER LEAF BENT DOWN AND CAPTURED THE GLASS CAT ROLLING AROUND THE LITTLE CREATURE UNTIL SHE WAS COMPLETELY HIDDEN AND THEN STRAIGHTENING UP AGAIN UPON ITS STEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-43 LOOK OUT CRIED THE WOOZY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-44 RUN!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-45 RUN FAST OR YOU ARE LOST.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-46 OJO TURNED AND SAW THE WOOZY RUNNING SWIFTLY UP THE ROAD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-47 BUT THE LAST LEAF OF THE ROW OF PLANTS SEIZED THE BEAST EVEN AS HE RAN AND INSTANTLY HE DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-48 THE BOY HAD NO CHANCE TO ESCAPE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-49 HALF A DOZEN OF THE GREAT LEAVES WERE BENDING TOWARD HIM FROM DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS AND AS HE STOOD HESITATING ONE OF THEM CLUTCHED HIM IN ITS EMBRACE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-50 IN A FLASH HE WAS IN THE DARK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-51 THEN HE FELT HIMSELF GENTLY LIFTED UNTIL HE WAS SWAYING IN THE AIR WITH THE FOLDS OF THE LEAF HUGGING HIM ON ALL SIDES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-52 LET ME GO!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-53 BUT NEITHER STRUGGLES NOR PROTESTS HAD ANY EFFECT WHATEVER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-54 THE LEAF HELD HIM FIRMLY AND HE WAS A PRISONER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-55 THEN OJO QUIETED HIMSELF AND TRIED TO THINK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-56 DESPAIR FELL UPON HIM WHEN HE REMEMBERED THAT ALL HIS LITTLE PARTY HAD BEEN CAPTURED EVEN AS HE WAS AND THERE WAS NONE TO SAVE THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-57 I MIGHT HAVE EXPECTED IT HE SOBBED MISERABLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-58 I'M OJO THE UNLUCKY AND SOMETHING DREADFUL WAS SURE TO HAPPEN TO ME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-59 HE PUSHED AGAINST THE LEAF THAT HELD HIM AND FOUND IT TO BE SOFT BUT THICK AND FIRM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-60 IT WAS LIKE A GREAT BANDAGE ALL AROUND HIM AND HE FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO MOVE HIS BODY OR LIMBS IN ORDER TO CHANGE THEIR POSITION.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-61 THE MINUTES PASSED AND BECAME HOURS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-62 OJO WONDERED HOW LONG ONE COULD LIVE IN SUCH A CONDITION AND IF THE LEAF WOULD GRADUALLY SAP HIS STRENGTH AND EVEN HIS LIFE IN ORDER TO FEED ITSELF.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-63 THE LITTLE MUNCHKIN BOY HAD NEVER HEARD OF ANY PERSON DYING IN THE LAND OF OZ BUT HE KNEW ONE COULD SUFFER A GREAT DEAL OF PAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-64 HIS GREATEST FEAR AT THIS TIME WAS THAT HE WOULD ALWAYS REMAIN IMPRISONED IN THE BEAUTIFUL LEAF AND NEVER SEE THE LIGHT OF DAY AGAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-65 NO SOUND CAME TO HIM THROUGH THE LEAF,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-66 ALL AROUND WAS INTENSE SILENCE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-67 OJO WONDERED IF SCRAPS HAD STOPPED SCREAMING OR IF THE FOLDS OF THE LEAF PREVENTED HIS HEARING HER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-68 BY AND BY HE THOUGHT HE HEARD A WHISTLE AS OF SOME ONE WHISTLING A TUNE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-69 YES,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-70 IT REALLY MUST BE SOME ONE WHISTLING HE DECIDED FOR HE COULD FOLLOW THE STRAINS OF A PRETTY MUNCHKIN MELODY THAT UNC NUNKIE USED TO SING TO HIM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-71 THE SOUNDS WERE LOW AND SWEET AND ALTHOUGH THEY REACHED OJO'S EARS VERY FAINTLY THEY WERE CLEAR AND HARMONIOUS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-72 COULD THE LEAF WHISTLE OJO WONDERED?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-73 NEARER AND NEARER CAME THE SOUNDS AND THEN THEY SEEMED TO BE JUST THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LEAF THAT WAS HUGGING HIM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-74 SUDDENLY THE WHOLE LEAF TOPPLED AND FELL CARRYING THE BOY WITH IT AND WHILE HE SPRAWLED AT FULL LENGTH THE FOLDS SLOWLY RELAXED AND SET HIM FREE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-75 HE SCRAMBLED QUICKLY TO HIS FEET AND FOUND THAT A STRANGE MAN WAS STANDING BEFORE HIM A MAN SO CURIOUS IN APPEARANCE THAT THE BOY STARED WITH ROUND EYES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-76 HE WAS A BIG MAN WITH SHAGGY WHISKERS SHAGGY EYEBROWS SHAGGY HAIR BUT KINDLY BLUE EYES THAT WERE GENTLE AS THOSE OF A COW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-77 ON HIS HEAD WAS A GREEN VELVET HAT WITH A JEWELED BAND WHICH WAS ALL SHAGGY AROUND THE BRIM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-78 RICH BUT SHAGGY LACES WERE AT HIS THROAT,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-79 A COAT WITH SHAGGY EDGES WAS DECORATED WITH DIAMOND BUTTONS,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-80 THE VELVET BREECHES HAD JEWELED BUCKLES AT THE KNEES AND SHAGS ALL AROUND THE BOTTOMS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-81 ON HIS BREAST HUNG A MEDALLION BEARING A PICTURE OF PRINCESS DOROTHY OF OZ AND IN HIS HAND AS HE STOOD LOOKING AT OJO WAS A SHARP KNIFE SHAPED LIKE A DAGGER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-82 OH!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-83 EXCLAIMED OJO GREATLY ASTONISHED AT THE SIGHT OF THIS STRANGER,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-84 AND THEN HE ADDED, WHO HAS SAVED ME SIR?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-85 CAN'T YOU SEE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-86 REPLIED THE OTHER WITH A SMILE,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-87 I'M THE SHAGGY MAN. YES,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-88 I CAN SEE THAT SAID THE BOY NODDING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-89 WAS IT YOU WHO RESCUED ME FROM THE LEAF?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-90 NONE OTHER YOU MAY BE SURE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-91 BUT TAKE CARE OR I SHALL HAVE TO RESCUE YOU AGAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-92 OJO GAVE A JUMP FOR HE SAW SEVERAL BROAD LEAVES LEANING TOWARD HIM,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-93 BUT THE SHAGGY MAN BEGAN TO WHISTLE AGAIN AND AT THE SOUND THE LEAVES ALL STRAIGHTENED UP ON THEIR STEMS AND KEPT STILL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-94 THE MAN NOW TOOK OJO'S ARM AND LED HIM UP THE ROAD PAST THE LAST OF THE GREAT PLANTS AND NOT TILL HE WAS SAFELY BEYOND THEIR REACH DID HE CEASE HIS WHISTLING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-95 YOU SEE THE MUSIC CHARMS EM SAID HE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-96 SINGING OR WHISTLING IT DOESN'T MATTER WHICH MAKES EM BEHAVE AND NOTHING ELSE WILL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-97 I ALWAYS WHISTLE AS I GO BY EM AND SO THEY ALWAYS LET ME ALONE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-98 TO DAY AS I WENT BY WHISTLING I SAW A LEAF CURLED AND KNEW THERE MUST BE SOMETHING INSIDE IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-99 I CUT DOWN THE LEAF WITH MY KNIFE AND OUT YOU POPPED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-100 LUCKY I PASSED BY WASN'T IT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-101 YOU WERE VERY KIND SAID OJO AND I THANK YOU.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-102 WILL YOU PLEASE RESCUE MY COMPANIONS ALSO?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-103 WHAT COMPANIONS?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-104 ASKED THE SHAGGY MAN. THE LEAVES GRABBED THEM ALL SAID THE BOY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-105 THERE'S A PATCHWORK GIRL AND A WHAT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-106 A GIRL MADE OF PATCHWORK YOU KNOW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-107 SHE'S ALIVE AND HER NAME IS SCRAPS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-108 AND THERE'S A GLASS CAT GLASS?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-109 ASKED THE SHAGGY MAN. ALL GLASS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-110 AND ALIVE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-111 YES SAID OJO,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-112 SHE HAS PINK BRAINS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-113 AND THERE'S A WOOZY WHAT'S A WOOZY?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-114 INQUIRED THE SHAGGY MAN. WHY I I CAN'T DESCRIBE IT ANSWERED THE BOY GREATLY PERPLEXED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-115 BUT IT'S A QUEER ANIMAL WITH THREE HAIRS ON THE TIP OF ITS TAIL THAT WON'T COME OUT AND WHAT WON'T COME OUT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-116 ASKED THE SHAGGY MAN,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-117 THE TAIL?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-118 THE HAIRS WON'T COME OUT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-119 BUT YOU'LL SEE THE WOOZY IF YOU'LL PLEASE RESCUE IT AND THEN YOU'LL KNOW JUST WHAT IT IS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-120 OF COURSE SAID THE SHAGGY MAN NODDING HIS SHAGGY HEAD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-121 AND THEN HE WALKED BACK AMONG THE PLANTS STILL WHISTLING AND FOUND THE THREE LEAVES WHICH WERE CURLED AROUND OJO'S TRAVELING COMPANIONS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-122 THE FIRST LEAF HE CUT DOWN RELEASED SCRAPS AND ON SEEING HER THE SHAGGY MAN THREW BACK HIS SHAGGY HEAD OPENED WIDE HIS MOUTH AND LAUGHED SO SHAGGILY AND YET SO MERRILY THAT SCRAPS LIKED HIM AT ONCE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-123 THEN HE TOOK OFF HIS HAT AND MADE HER A LOW BOW SAYING, MY DEAR YOU'RE A WONDER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-124 I MUST INTRODUCE YOU TO MY FRIEND THE SCARECROW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-125 WHEN HE CUT DOWN THE SECOND LEAF HE RESCUED THE GLASS CAT AND BUNGLE WAS SO FRIGHTENED THAT SHE SCAMPERED AWAY LIKE A STREAK AND SOON HAD JOINED OJO WHEN SHE SAT BESIDE HIM PANTING AND TREMBLING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-126 THE LAST PLANT OF ALL THE ROW HAD CAPTURED THE WOOZY AND A BIG BUNCH IN THE CENTER OF THE CURLED LEAF SHOWED PLAINLY WHERE HE WAS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-10-127 WITH HIS SHARP KNIFE THE SHAGGY MAN SLICED OFF THE STEM OF THE LEAF AND AS IT FELL AND UNFOLDED OUT TROTTED THE WOOZY AND ESCAPED BEYOND THE REACH OF ANY MORE OF THE DANGEROUS PLANTS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-01 CHAPTER ELEVEN A GOOD FRIEND SOON THE ENTIRE PARTY WAS GATHERED ON THE ROAD OF YELLOW BRICKS QUITE BEYOND THE REACH OF THE BEAUTIFUL BUT TREACHEROUS PLANTS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-02 THE SHAGGY MAN STARING FIRST AT ONE AND THEN AT THE OTHER SEEMED GREATLY PLEASED AND INTERESTED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-03 I'VE SEEN QUEER THINGS SINCE I CAME TO THE LAND OF OZ SAID HE BUT NEVER ANYTHING QUEERER THAN THIS BAND OF ADVENTURERS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-04 LET US SIT DOWN A WHILE AND HAVE A TALK AND GET ACQUAINTED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-05 HAVEN'T YOU ALWAYS LIVED IN THE LAND OF OZ?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-06 ASKED THE MUNCHKIN BOY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-07 NO,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-08 I USED TO LIVE IN THE BIG OUTSIDE WORLD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-09 BUT I CAME HERE ONCE WITH DOROTHY AND OZMA LET ME STAY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-10 HOW DO YOU LIKE OZ?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-11 ASKED SCRAPS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-12 ISN'T THE COUNTRY AND THE CLIMATE GRAND?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-13 IT'S THE FINEST COUNTRY IN ALL THE WORLD EVEN IF IT IS A FAIRYLAND AND I'M HAPPY EVERY MINUTE I LIVE IN IT SAID THE SHAGGY MAN. BUT TELL ME SOMETHING ABOUT YOURSELVES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-14 SO OJO RELATED THE STORY OF HIS VISIT TO THE HOUSE OF THE CROOKED MAGICIAN AND HOW HE MET THERE THE GLASS CAT AND HOW THE PATCHWORK GIRL WAS BROUGHT TO LIFE AND OF THE TERRIBLE ACCIDENT TO UNC NUNKIE AND MARGOLOTTE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-15 THEN HE TOLD HOW HE HAD SET OUT TO FIND THE FIVE DIFFERENT THINGS WHICH THE MAGICIAN NEEDED TO MAKE A CHARM THAT WOULD RESTORE THE MARBLE FIGURES TO LIFE ONE REQUIREMENT BEING THREE HAIRS FROM A WOOZY'S TAIL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-16 WE FOUND THE WOOZY EXPLAINED THE BOY AND HE AGREED TO GIVE US THE THREE HAIRS,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-17 BUT WE COULDN'T PULL THEM OUT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-18 SO WE HAD TO BRING THE WOOZY ALONG WITH US.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-19 I SEE RETURNED THE SHAGGY MAN WHO HAD LISTENED WITH INTEREST TO THE STORY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-20 BUT PERHAPS I WHO AM BIG AND STRONG CAN PULL THOSE THREE HAIRS FROM THE WOOZY'S TAIL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-21 TRY IT IF YOU LIKE SAID THE WOOZY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-22 SO THE SHAGGY MAN TRIED IT BUT PULL AS HARD AS HE COULD HE FAILED TO GET THE HAIRS OUT OF THE WOOZY'S TAIL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-23 SO HE SAT DOWN AGAIN AND WIPED HIS SHAGGY FACE WITH A SHAGGY SILK HANDKERCHIEF AND SAID, IT DOESN'T MATTER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-24 IF YOU CAN KEEP THE WOOZY UNTIL YOU GET THE REST OF THE THINGS YOU NEED YOU CAN TAKE THE BEAST AND HIS THREE HAIRS TO THE CROOKED MAGICIAN AND LET HIM FIND A WAY TO EXTRACT EM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-25 WHAT ARE THE OTHER THINGS YOU ARE TO FIND?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-26 ONE SAID OJO IS A SIX LEAVED CLOVER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-27 YOU OUGHT TO FIND THAT IN THE FIELDS AROUND THE EMERALD CITY SAID THE SHAGGY MAN. THERE IS A LAW AGAINST PICKING SIX LEAVED CLOVERS BUT I THINK I CAN GET OZMA TO LET YOU HAVE ONE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-28 THANK YOU REPLIED OJO. THE NEXT THING IS THE LEFT WING OF A YELLOW BUTTERFLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-29 FOR THAT YOU MUST GO TO THE WINKIE COUNTRY THE SHAGGY MAN DECLARED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-30 I'VE NEVER NOTICED ANY BUTTERFLIES THERE BUT THAT IS THE YELLOW COUNTRY OF OZ AND IT'S RULED BY A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE THE TIN WOODMAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-31 OH I'VE HEARD OF HIM!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-32 EXCLAIMED OJO. HE MUST BE A WONDERFUL MAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-33 SO HE IS AND HIS HEART IS WONDERFULLY KIND.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-34 I'M SURE THE TIN WOODMAN WILL DO ALL IN HIS POWER TO HELP YOU TO SAVE YOUR UNC NUNKIE AND POOR MARGOLOTTE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-35 THE NEXT THING I MUST FIND SAID THE MUNCHKIN BOY IS A GILL OF WATER FROM A DARK WELL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-36 INDEED!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-37 WELL THAT IS MORE DIFFICULT SAID THE SHAGGY MAN SCRATCHING HIS LEFT EAR IN A PUZZLED WAY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-38 I'VE NEVER HEARD OF A DARK WELL,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-39 HAVE YOU?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-40 NO SAID OJO. DO YOU KNOW WHERE ONE MAY BE FOUND?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-41 INQUIRED THE SHAGGY MAN. I CAN'T IMAGINE SAID OJO. THEN WE MUST ASK THE SCARECROW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-42 THE SCARECROW!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-43 BUT SURELY SIR A SCARECROW CAN'T KNOW ANYTHING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-44 MOST SCARECROWS DON'T I ADMIT ANSWERED THE SHAGGY MAN. BUT THIS SCARECROW OF WHOM I SPEAK IS VERY INTELLIGENT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-45 HE CLAIMS TO POSSESS THE BEST BRAINS IN ALL OZ. BETTER THAN MINE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-46 ASKED SCRAPS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-47 BETTER THAN MINE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-48 ECHOED THE GLASS CAT. MINE ARE PINK AND YOU CAN SEE EM WORK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-49 WELL YOU CAN'T SEE THE SCARECROW'S BRAINS WORK BUT THEY DO A LOT OF CLEVER THINKING ASSERTED THE SHAGGY MAN. IF ANYONE KNOWS WHERE A DARK WELL IS IT'S MY FRIEND THE SCARECROW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-50 WHERE DOES HE LIVE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-51 OJO. HE HAS A SPLENDID CASTLE IN THE WINKIE COUNTRY NEAR TO THE PALACE OF HIS FRIEND THE TIN WOODMAN AND HE IS OFTEN TO BE FOUND IN THE EMERALD CITY WHERE HE VISITS DOROTHY AT THE ROYAL PALACE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-52 THEN WE WILL ASK HIM ABOUT THE DARK WELL SAID OJO. BUT WHAT ELSE DOES THIS CROOKED MAGICIAN WANT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-53 ASKED THE SHAGGY MAN. A DROP OF OIL FROM A LIVE MAN'S BODY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-54 OH,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-55 BUT THERE ISN'T SUCH A THING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-56 THAT IS WHAT I THOUGHT REPLIED OJO,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-57 BUT THE CROOKED MAGICIAN SAID IT WOULDN'T BE CALLED FOR BY THE RECIPE IF IT COULDN'T BE FOUND AND THEREFORE I MUST SEARCH UNTIL I FIND IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-58 I WISH YOU GOOD LUCK SAID THE SHAGGY MAN SHAKING HIS HEAD DOUBTFULLY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-59 BUT I IMAGINE YOU'LL HAVE A HARD JOB GETTING A DROP OF OIL FROM A LIVE MAN'S BODY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-60 THERE'S BLOOD IN A BODY BUT NO OIL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-61 THERE'S COTTON IN MINE SAID SCRAPS DANCING A LITTLE JIG.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-62 I DON'T DOUBT IT RETURNED THE SHAGGY MAN ADMIRINGLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-63 YOU'RE A REGULAR COMFORTER AND AS SWEET AS PATCHWORK CAN BE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-64 ALL YOU LACK IS DIGNITY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-65 I HATE DIGNITY CRIED SCRAPS KICKING A PEBBLE HIGH IN THE AIR AND THEN TRYING TO CATCH IT AS IT FELL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-66 HALF THE FOOLS AND ALL THE WISE FOLKS ARE DIGNIFIED AND I'M NEITHER THE ONE NOR THE OTHER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-67 SHE'S JUST CRAZY EXPLAINED THE GLASS CAT. THE SHAGGY MAN LAUGHED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-68 SHE'S DELIGHTFUL IN HER WAY HE SAID.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-69 I'M SURE DOROTHY WILL BE PLEASED WITH HER AND THE SCARECROW WILL DOTE ON HER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-70 DID YOU SAY YOU WERE TRAVELING TOWARD THE EMERALD CITY?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-71 YES REPLIED OJO. I THOUGHT THAT THE BEST PLACE TO GO AT FIRST BECAUSE THE SIX LEAVED CLOVER MAY BE FOUND THERE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-72 I'LL GO WITH YOU SAID THE SHAGGY MAN AND SHOW YOU THE WAY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-73 THANK YOU EXCLAIMED OJO. I HOPE IT WON'T PUT YOU OUT ANY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-74 NO SAID THE OTHER I WASN'T GOING ANYWHERE IN PARTICULAR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-75 I'VE BEEN A ROVER ALL MY LIFE AND ALTHOUGH OZMA HAS GIVEN ME A SUITE OF BEAUTIFUL ROOMS IN HER PALACE I STILL GET THE WANDERING FEVER ONCE IN A WHILE AND START OUT TO ROAM THE COUNTRY OVER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-76 I'VE BEEN AWAY FROM THE EMERALD CITY SEVERAL WEEKS THIS TIME AND NOW THAT I'VE MET YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS I'M SURE IT WILL INTEREST ME TO ACCOMPANY YOU TO THE GREAT CITY OF OZ AND INTRODUCE YOU TO MY FRIENDS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-77 THAT WILL BE VERY NICE SAID THE BOY GRATEFULLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-78 I HOPE YOUR FRIENDS ARE NOT DIGNIFIED OBSERVED SCRAPS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-79 SOME ARE AND SOME ARE NOT HE ANSWERED,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-80 BUT I NEVER CRITICISE MY FRIENDS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-81 IF THEY ARE REALLY TRUE FRIENDS THEY MAY BE ANYTHING THEY LIKE FOR ALL OF ME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-82 THERE'S SOME SENSE IN THAT SAID SCRAPS NODDING HER QUEER HEAD IN APPROVAL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-83 COME ON AND LET'S GET TO THE EMERALD CITY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-84 WITH THIS SHE RAN UP THE PATH SKIPPING AND DANCING AND THEN TURNED TO AWAIT THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-85 IT IS QUITE A DISTANCE FROM HERE TO THE EMERALD CITY REMARKED THE SHAGGY MAN SO WE SHALL NOT GET THERE TO DAY NOR TO MORROW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-86 THEREFORE LET US TAKE THE JAUNT IN AN EASY MANNER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-87 I'M AN OLD TRAVELER AND HAVE FOUND THAT I NEVER GAIN ANYTHING BY BEING IN A HURRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-88 TAKE IT EASY IS MY MOTTO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-89 IF YOU CAN'T TAKE IT EASY TAKE IT AS EASY AS YOU CAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-90 AFTER WALKING SOME DISTANCE OVER THE ROAD OF YELLOW BRICKS OJO SAID HE WAS HUNGRY AND WOULD STOP TO EAT SOME BREAD AND CHEESE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-91 HE OFFERED A PORTION OF THE FOOD TO THE SHAGGY MAN WHO THANKED HIM BUT REFUSED IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-92 WHEN I START OUT ON MY TRAVELS SAID HE I CARRY ALONG ENOUGH SQUARE MEALS TO LAST ME SEVERAL WEEKS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-93 THINK I'LL INDULGE IN ONE NOW AS LONG AS WE'RE STOPPING ANYWAY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-94 SAYING THIS HE TOOK A BOTTLE FROM HIS POCKET AND SHOOK FROM IT A TABLET ABOUT THE SIZE OF ONE OF OJO'S FINGER NAILS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-95 THAT ANNOUNCED THE SHAGGY MAN IS A SQUARE MEAL IN CONDENSED FORM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-96 INVENTION OF THE GREAT PROFESSOR WOGGLE BUG OF THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF ATHLETICS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-97 IT CONTAINS SOUP FISH ROAST MEAT SALAD APPLE DUMPLINGS ICE CREAM AND CHOCOLATE DROPS ALL BOILED DOWN TO THIS SMALL SIZE SO IT CAN BE CONVENIENTLY CARRIED AND SWALLOWED WHEN YOU ARE HUNGRY AND NEED A SQUARE MEAL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-98 I'M SQUARE SAID THE WOOZY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-99 GIVE ME ONE PLEASE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-100 SO THE SHAGGY MAN GAVE THE WOOZY A TABLET FROM HIS BOTTLE AND THE BEAST ATE IT IN A TWINKLING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-101 YOU HAVE NOW HAD A SIX COURSE DINNER DECLARED THE SHAGGY MAN. PSHAW!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-102 SAID THE WOOZY UNGRATEFULLY I WANT TO TASTE SOMETHING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-103 THERE'S NO FUN IN THAT SORT OF EATING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-104 ONE SHOULD ONLY EAT TO SUSTAIN LIFE REPLIED THE SHAGGY MAN AND THAT TABLET IS EQUAL TO A PECK OF OTHER FOOD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-105 I DON'T CARE FOR IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-106 I WANT SOMETHING I CAN CHEW AND TASTE GRUMBLED THE WOOZY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-107 YOU ARE QUITE WRONG MY POOR BEAST SAID THE SHAGGY MAN IN A TONE OF PITY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-108 THINK HOW TIRED YOUR JAWS WOULD GET CHEWING A SQUARE MEAL LIKE THIS IF IT WERE NOT CONDENSED TO THE SIZE OF A SMALL TABLET WHICH YOU CAN SWALLOW IN A JIFFY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-109 CHEWING ISN'T TIRESOME,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-110 IT'S FUN MAINTAINED THE WOOZY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-111 I ALWAYS CHEW THE HONEY BEES WHEN I CATCH THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-112 GIVE ME SOME BREAD AND CHEESE OJO. NO NO!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-113 YOU'VE ALREADY EATEN A BIG DINNER!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-114 BUT I GUESS I'LL FOOL MYSELF BY MUNCHING SOME BREAD AND CHEESE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-115 I MAY NOT BE HUNGRY HAVING EATEN ALL THOSE THINGS YOU GAVE ME BUT I CONSIDER THIS EATING BUSINESS A MATTER OF TASTE AND I LIKE TO REALIZE WHAT'S GOING INTO ME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-116 OJO GAVE THE BEAST WHAT HE WANTED BUT THE SHAGGY MAN SHOOK HIS SHAGGY HEAD REPROACHFULLY AND SAID THERE WAS NO ANIMAL SO OBSTINATE OR HARD TO CONVINCE AS A WOOZY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-117 AT THIS MOMENT A PATTER OF FOOTSTEPS WAS HEARD AND LOOKING UP THEY SAW THE LIVE PHONOGRAPH STANDING BEFORE THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-118 IT SEEMED TO HAVE PASSED THROUGH MANY ADVENTURES SINCE OJO AND HIS COMRADES LAST SAW THE MACHINE FOR THE VARNISH OF ITS WOODEN CASE WAS ALL MARRED AND DENTED AND SCRATCHED IN A WAY THAT GAVE IT AN AGED AND DISREPUTABLE APPEARANCE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-119 DEAR ME!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-120 EXCLAIMED OJO STARING HARD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-121 WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO YOU?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-122 NOTHING MUCH REPLIED THE PHONOGRAPH IN A SAD AND DEPRESSED VOICE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-123 I'VE HAD ENOUGH THINGS THROWN AT ME SINCE I LEFT YOU TO STOCK A DEPARTMENT STORE AND FURNISH HALF A DOZEN BARGAIN COUNTERS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-124 ARE YOU SO BROKEN UP THAT YOU CAN'T PLAY?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-125 ASKED SCRAPS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-126 NO,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-127 AM ABLE TO GRIND OUT DELICIOUS MUSIC.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-128 JUST NOW I'VE A RECORD ON TAP THAT IS REALLY SUPERB SAID THE PHONOGRAPH GROWING MORE CHEERFUL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-129 THAT IS TOO BAD REMARKED OJO. WE'VE NO OBJECTION TO YOU AS A MACHINE YOU KNOW,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-130 BUT AS A MUSIC MAKER WE HATE YOU.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-131 THEN WHY WAS I EVER INVENTED?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-132 DEMANDED THE MACHINE IN A TONE OF INDIGNANT PROTEST.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-133 THEY LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER INQUIRINGLY BUT NO ONE COULD ANSWER SUCH A PUZZLING QUESTION.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-134 FINALLY THE SHAGGY MAN SAID, I'D LIKE TO HEAR THE PHONOGRAPH PLAY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-135 OJO SIGHED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-136 WE'VE BEEN VERY HAPPY SINCE WE MET YOU SIR HE SAID.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-137 I KNOW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-138 BUT A LITTLE MISERY AT TIMES MAKES ONE APPRECIATE HAPPINESS MORE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-139 TELL ME PHONY WHAT IS THIS RECORD LIKE WHICH YOU SAY YOU HAVE ON TAP?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-140 IT'S A POPULAR SONG SIR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-141 IN ALL CIVILIZED LANDS THE COMMON PEOPLE HAVE GONE WILD OVER IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-142 MAKES CIVILIZED FOLKS WILD FOLKS EH?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-143 THEN IT'S DANGEROUS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-144 WILD WITH JOY I MEAN EXPLAINED THE PHONOGRAPH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-145 LISTEN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-146 THIS SONG WILL PROVE A RARE TREAT TO YOU I KNOW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-147 IT MADE THE AUTHOR RICH FOR AN AUTHOR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-148 IT IS CALLED MY LULU.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-149 THEN THE PHONOGRAPH BEGAN TO PLAY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-150 A STRAIN OF ODD JERKY SOUNDS WAS FOLLOWED BY THESE WORDS SUNG BY A MAN THROUGH HIS NOSE WITH GREAT VIGOR OF EXPRESSION, AH WANTS MAH LULU MAH COAL BLACK LULU,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-151 AH WANTS MAH LOO LOO LOO LOO LOO LOO LU!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-152 AH LOVES MAH LULU MAH COAL BLACK LULU THERE AIN'T NOBODY ELSE LOVES LOO LOO LU!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-153 HERE SHUT THAT OFF!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-154 CRIED THE SHAGGY MAN SPRINGING TO HIS FEET.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-155 WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY SUCH IMPERTINENCE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-156 IT'S THE LATEST POPULAR SONG DECLARED THE PHONOGRAPH SPEAKING IN A SULKY TONE OF VOICE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-157 A POPULAR SONG?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-158 YES. ONE THAT THE FEEBLE MINDED CAN REMEMBER THE WORDS OF AND THOSE IGNORANT OF MUSIC CAN WHISTLE OR SING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-159 THAT MAKES A POPULAR SONG POPULAR AND THE TIME IS COMING WHEN IT WILL TAKE THE PLACE OF ALL OTHER SONGS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-160 THAT TIME WON'T COME TO US JUST YET SAID THE SHAGGY MAN STERNLY, I'M SOMETHING OF A SINGER MYSELF AND I DON'T INTEND TO BE THROTTLED BY ANY LULUS LIKE YOUR COAL BLACK ONE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-161 I SHALL TAKE YOU ALL APART MISTER PHONY AND SCATTER YOUR PIECES FAR AND WIDE OVER THE COUNTRY AS A MATTER OF KINDNESS TO THE PEOPLE YOU MIGHT MEET IF ALLOWED TO RUN AROUND LOOSE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-162 HAVING PERFORMED THIS PAINFUL DUTY I SHALL BUT BEFORE HE COULD SAY MORE THE PHONOGRAPH TURNED AND DASHED UP THE ROAD AS FAST AS ITS FOUR TABLE LEGS COULD CARRY IT AND SOON IT HAD ENTIRELY DISAPPEARED FROM THEIR VIEW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-163 THE SHAGGY MAN SAT DOWN AGAIN AND SEEMED WELL PLEASED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-164 SOME ONE ELSE WILL SAVE ME THE TROUBLE OF SCATTERING THAT PHONOGRAPH SAID HE,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-165 FOR IT IS NOT POSSIBLE THAT SUCH A MUSIC MAKER CAN LAST LONG IN THE LAND OF OZ. WHEN YOU ARE RESTED FRIENDS LET US GO ON OUR WAY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-166 DURING THE AFTERNOON THE TRAVELERS FOUND THEMSELVES IN A LONELY AND UNINHABITED PART OF THE COUNTRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-167 EVEN THE FIELDS WERE NO LONGER CULTIVATED AND THE COUNTRY BEGAN TO RESEMBLE A WILDERNESS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-168 THE ROAD OF YELLOW BRICKS SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN NEGLECTED AND BECAME UNEVEN AND MORE DIFFICULT TO WALK UPON.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-169 SCRUBBY UNDER BRUSH GREW ON EITHER SIDE OF THE WAY WHILE HUGE ROCKS WERE SCATTERED AROUND IN ABUNDANCE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-170 BUT THIS DID NOT DETER OJO AND HIS FRIENDS FROM TRUDGING ON AND THEY BEGUILED THE JOURNEY WITH JOKES AND CHEERFUL CONVERSATION.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-171 TOWARD EVENING THEY REACHED A CRYSTAL SPRING WHICH GUSHED FROM A TALL ROCK BY THE ROADSIDE AND NEAR THIS SPRING STOOD A DESERTED CABIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-172 SAID THE SHAGGY MAN HALTING HERE, WE MAY AS WELL PASS THE NIGHT HERE WHERE THERE IS SHELTER FOR OUR HEADS AND GOOD WATER TO DRINK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-173 ROAD BEYOND HERE IS PRETTY BAD,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-174 WORST WE SHALL HAVE TO TRAVEL,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-175 SO LET'S WAIT UNTIL MORNING BEFORE WE TACKLE IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-176 THEY AGREED TO THIS AND OJO FOUND SOME BRUSHWOOD IN THE CABIN AND MADE A FIRE ON THE HEARTH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-177 THE FIRE DELIGHTED SCRAPS WHO DANCED BEFORE IT UNTIL OJO WARNED HER SHE MIGHT SET FIRE TO HERSELF AND BURN UP.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-178 AFTER THAT THE PATCHWORK GIRL KEPT AT A RESPECTFUL DISTANCE FROM THE DARTING FLAMES BUT THE WOOZY LAY DOWN BEFORE THE FIRE LIKE A BIG DOG AND SEEMED TO ENJOY ITS WARMTH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-179 FOR SUPPER THE SHAGGY MAN ATE ONE OF HIS TABLETS BUT OJO STUCK TO HIS BREAD AND CHEESE AS THE MOST SATISFYING FOOD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-180 HE ALSO GAVE A PORTION TO THE WOOZY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-181 WHEN DARKNESS CAME ON AND THEY SAT IN A CIRCLE ON THE CABIN FLOOR FACING THE FIRELIGHT THERE BEING NO FURNITURE OF ANY SORT IN THE PLACE OJO SAID TO THE SHAGGY MAN, WON'T YOU TELL US A STORY?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-182 I'M NOT GOOD AT STORIES WAS THE REPLY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-183 BUT I SING LIKE A BIRD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-184 RAVEN OR CROW?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-185 ASKED THE GLASS CAT. LIKE A SONG BIRD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-186 I'LL PROVE IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-187 I'LL SING A SONG I COMPOSED MYSELF.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-188 DON'T TELL ANYONE I'M A POET,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-189 THEY MIGHT WANT ME TO WRITE A BOOK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-190 DON'T TELL EM I CAN SING OR THEY'D WANT ME TO MAKE RECORDS FOR THAT AWFUL PHONOGRAPH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-191 HAVEN'T TIME TO BE A PUBLIC BENEFACTOR SO I'LL JUST SING YOU THIS LITTLE SONG FOR YOUR OWN AMUSEMENT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-192 THEY WERE GLAD ENOUGH TO BE ENTERTAINED AND LISTENED WITH INTEREST WHILE THE SHAGGY MAN CHANTED THE FOLLOWING VERSES TO A TUNE THAT WAS NOT UNPLEASANT, I'LL SING A SONG OF OZLAND WHERE WONDROUS CREATURES DWELL AND FRUITS AND FLOWERS AND SHADY BOWERS ABOUND IN EVERY DELL WHERE MAGIC IS A SCIENCE AND WHERE NO ONE SHOWS SURPRISE IF SOME AMAZING THING TAKES PLACE BEFORE HIS VERY EYES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-193 OUR RULER'S A BEWITCHING GIRL WHOM FAIRIES LOVE TO PLEASE,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-194 SHE'S ALWAYS KEPT HER MAGIC SCEPTRE TO ENFORCE DECREES TO MAKE HER PEOPLE HAPPY FOR HER HEART IS KIND AND TRUE AND TO AID THE NEEDY AND DISTRESSED IS WHAT SHE LONGS TO DO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-195 AND THEN THERE'S PRINCESS DOROTHY AS SWEET AS ANY ROSE A LASS FROM KANSAS WHERE THEY DON'T GROW FAIRIES I SUPPOSE,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-196 AND THERE'S THE BRAINY SCARECROW WITH A BODY STUFFED WITH STRAW WHO UTTERS WORDS OF WISDOM RARE THAT FILL US ALL WITH AWE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-197 I'LL NOT FORGET NICK CHOPPER THE WOODMAN MADE OF TIN WHOSE TENDER HEART THINKS KILLING TIME IS QUITE A DREADFUL SIN NOR OLD PROFESSOR WOGGLE BUG WHO'S HIGHLY MAGNIFIED AND LOOKS SO BIG TO EVERYONE THAT HE IS FILLED WITH PRIDE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-198 JACK PUMPKINHEAD'S A DEAR OLD CHUM WHO MIGHT BE CALLED A CHUMP BUT WON RENOWN BY RIDING ROUND UPON A MAGIC GUMP,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-199 THE SAWHORSE IS A SPLENDID STEED AND THOUGH HE'S MADE OF WOOD HE DOES AS MANY THRILLING STUNTS AS ANY MEAT HORSE COULD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-200 AND NOW I'LL INTRODUCE A BEAST THAT EV'RYONE ADORES THE COWARDLY LION SHAKES WITH FEAR MOST EV'RY TIME HE ROARS AND YET HE DOES THE BRAVEST THINGS THAT ANY LION MIGHT BECAUSE HE KNOWS THAT COWARDICE IS NOT CONSIDERED RIGHT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-201 THERE'S TIK TOK HE'S A CLOCKWORK MAN AND QUITE A FUNNY SIGHT HE TALKS AND WALKS MECHANICALLY WHEN HE'S WOUND UP TIGHT,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-202 AND WE'VE A HUNGRY TIGER WHO WOULD BABIES LOVE TO EAT BUT NEVER DOES BECAUSE WE FEED HIM OTHER KINDS OF MEAT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-203 IT'S HARD TO NAME ALL OF THE FREAKS THIS NOBLE LAND'S ACQUIRED,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-204 TWOULD MAKE MY SONG SO VERY LONG THAT YOU WOULD SOON BE TIRED,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-205 BUT GIVE ATTENTION WHILE I MENTION ONE WISE YELLOW HEN AND NINE FINE TINY PIGLETS LIVING IN A GOLDEN PEN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-206 JUST SEARCH THE WHOLE WORLD OVER SAIL THE SEAS FROM COAST TO COAST NO OTHER NATION IN CREATION QUEERER FOLK CAN BOAST,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-207 AND NOW OUR RARE MUSEUM WILL INCLUDE A CAT OF GLASS A WOOZY AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST A CRAZY PATCHWORK LASS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-208 OJO WAS SO PLEASED WITH THIS SONG THAT HE APPLAUDED THE SINGER BY CLAPPING HIS HANDS AND SCRAPS FOLLOWED SUIT BY CLAPPING HER PADDED FINGERS TOGETHER ALTHOUGH THEY MADE NO NOISE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-209 THE CAT POUNDED ON THE FLOOR WITH HER GLASS PAWS GENTLY SO AS NOT TO BREAK THEM AND THE WOOZY WHICH HAD BEEN ASLEEP WOKE UP TO ASK WHAT THE ROW WAS ABOUT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-210 I SELDOM SING IN PUBLIC FOR FEAR THEY MIGHT WANT ME TO START AN OPERA COMPANY REMARKED THE SHAGGY MAN WHO WAS PLEASED TO KNOW HIS EFFORT WAS APPRECIATED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-211 VOICE JUST NOW IS A LITTLE OUT OF TRAINING,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-212 RUSTY PERHAPS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-213 TELL ME SAID THE PATCHWORK GIRL EARNESTLY DO ALL THOSE QUEER PEOPLE YOU MENTION REALLY LIVE IN THE LAND OF OZ?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-214 EVERY ONE OF EM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-215 I EVEN FORGOT ONE THING, DOROTHY'S PINK KITTEN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-216 FOR GOODNESS SAKE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-217 EXCLAIMED BUNGLE SITTING UP AND LOOKING INTERESTED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-218 A PINK KITTEN?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-219 HOW ABSURD!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-220 IS IT GLASS?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-221 NO,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-222 JUST ORDINARY KITTEN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-223 THEN IT CAN'T AMOUNT TO MUCH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-224 I HAVE PINK BRAINS AND YOU CAN SEE EM WORK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-225 DOROTHY'S KITTEN IS ALL PINK BRAINS AND ALL EXCEPT BLUE EYES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-226 NAME'S EUREKA.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-227 GREAT FAVORITE AT THE ROYAL PALACE SAID THE SHAGGY MAN YAWNING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-228 THE GLASS CAT SEEMED ANNOYED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-229 DO YOU THINK A PINK KITTEN COMMON MEAT IS AS PRETTY AS I AM?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-230 SHE ASKED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-231 CAN'T SAY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-232 TASTES DIFFER YOU KNOW REPLIED THE SHAGGY MAN YAWNING AGAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-233 BUT HERE'S A POINTER THAT MAY BE OF SERVICE TO YOU, MAKE FRIENDS WITH EUREKA AND YOU'LL BE SOLID AT THE PALACE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-234 I'M SOLID NOW,

l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-236 YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND REJOINED THE SHAGGY MAN SLEEPILY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-237 ANYHOW MAKE FRIENDS WITH THE PINK KITTEN AND YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-238 IF THE PINK KITTEN DESPISES YOU LOOK OUT FOR BREAKERS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-239 WOULD ANYONE AT THE ROYAL PALACE BREAK A GLASS CAT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-240 MIGHT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-241 YOU NEVER CAN TELL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-242 ADVISE YOU TO PURR SOFT AND LOOK HUMBLE IF YOU CAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-243 AND NOW I'M GOING TO BED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-11-244 BUNGLE CONSIDERED THE SHAGGY MAN'S ADVICE SO CAREFULLY THAT HER PINK BRAINS WERE BUSY LONG AFTER THE OTHERS OF THE PARTY WERE FAST ASLEEP.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-01 CHAPTER TWELVE THE GIANT PORCUPINE NEXT MORNING THEY STARTED OUT BRIGHT AND EARLY TO FOLLOW THE ROAD OF YELLOW BRICKS TOWARD THE EMERALD CITY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-02 THE LITTLE MUNCHKIN BOY WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL TIRED FROM THE LONG WALK AND HE HAD A GREAT MANY THINGS TO THINK OF AND CONSIDER BESIDES THE EVENTS OF THE JOURNEY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-03 AT THE WONDERFUL EMERALD CITY WHICH HE WOULD PRESENTLY REACH WERE SO MANY STRANGE AND CURIOUS PEOPLE THAT HE WAS HALF AFRAID OF MEETING THEM AND WONDERED IF THEY WOULD PROVE FRIENDLY AND KIND.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-04 ABOVE ALL ELSE HE COULD NOT DRIVE FROM HIS MIND THE IMPORTANT ERRAND ON WHICH HE HAD COME AND HE WAS DETERMINED TO DEVOTE EVERY ENERGY TO FINDING THE THINGS THAT WERE NECESSARY TO PREPARE THE MAGIC RECIPE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-05 HE BELIEVED THAT UNTIL DEAR UNC NUNKIE WAS RESTORED TO LIFE HE COULD FEEL NO JOY IN ANYTHING AND OFTEN HE WISHED THAT UNC COULD BE WITH HIM TO SEE ALL THE ASTONISHING THINGS OJO WAS SEEING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-06 BUT ALAS UNC NUNKIE WAS NOW A MARBLE STATUE IN THE HOUSE OF THE CROOKED MAGICIAN AND OJO MUST NOT FALTER IN HIS EFFORTS TO SAVE HIM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-07 THE COUNTRY THROUGH WHICH THEY WERE PASSING WAS STILL ROCKY AND DESERTED WITH HERE AND THERE A BUSH OR A TREE TO BREAK THE DREARY LANDSCAPE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-08 OJO NOTICED ONE TREE ESPECIALLY BECAUSE IT HAD SUCH LONG SILKY LEAVES AND WAS SO BEAUTIFUL IN SHAPE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-09 AS HE APPROACHED IT HE STUDIED THE TREE EARNESTLY WONDERING IF ANY FRUIT GREW ON IT OR IF IT BORE PRETTY FLOWERS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-10 SUDDENLY HE BECAME AWARE THAT HE HAD BEEN LOOKING AT THAT TREE A LONG TIME AT LEAST FOR FIVE MINUTES AND IT HAD REMAINED IN THE SAME POSITION ALTHOUGH THE BOY HAD CONTINUED TO WALK STEADILY ON.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-11 SO HE STOPPED SHORT AND WHEN HE STOPPED THE TREE AND ALL THE LANDSCAPE AS WELL AS HIS COMPANIONS MOVED ON BEFORE HIM AND LEFT HIM FAR BEHIND.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-12 OJO UTTERED SUCH A CRY OF ASTONISHMENT THAT IT AROUSED THE SHAGGY MAN WHO ALSO HALTED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-13 THE OTHERS THEN STOPPED TOO AND WALKED BACK TO THE BOY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-14 WHAT'S WRONG?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-15 ASKED THE SHAGGY MAN. WHY WE'RE NOT MOVING FORWARD A BIT NO MATTER HOW FAST WE WALK DECLARED OJO. NOW THAT WE HAVE STOPPED WE ARE MOVING BACKWARD!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-16 CAN'T YOU SEE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-17 JUST NOTICE THAT ROCK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-18 SCRAPS LOOKED DOWN AT HER FEET AND SAID, THE YELLOW BRICKS ARE NOT MOVING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-19 BUT THE WHOLE ROAD IS ANSWERED OJO. TRUE,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-20 QUITE TRUE AGREED THE SHAGGY MAN. I KNOW ALL ABOUT THE TRICKS OF THIS ROAD BUT I HAVE BEEN THINKING OF SOMETHING ELSE AND DIDN'T REALIZE WHERE WE WERE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-21 IT WILL CARRY US BACK TO WHERE WE STARTED FROM PREDICTED OJO BEGINNING TO BE NERVOUS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-22 NO REPLIED THE SHAGGY MAN,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-23 IT WON'T DO THAT FOR I KNOW A TRICK TO BEAT THIS TRICKY ROAD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-24 I'VE TRAVELED THIS WAY BEFORE YOU KNOW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-25 TURN AROUND ALL OF YOU AND WALK BACKWARD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-26 WHAT GOOD WILL THAT DO?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-27 ASKED THE CAT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-28 YOU'LL FIND OUT IF YOU OBEY ME SAID THE SHAGGY MAN. SO THEY ALL TURNED THEIR BACKS TO THE DIRECTION IN WHICH THEY WISHED TO GO AND BEGAN WALKING BACKWARD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-29 IN AN INSTANT OJO NOTICED THEY WERE GAINING GROUND AND AS THEY PROCEEDED IN THIS CURIOUS WAY THEY SOON PASSED THE TREE WHICH HAD FIRST ATTRACTED HIS ATTENTION TO THEIR DIFFICULTY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-30 HOW LONG MUST WE KEEP THIS UP SHAGS?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-31 ASKED SCRAPS WHO WAS CONSTANTLY TRIPPING AND TUMBLING DOWN ONLY TO GET UP AGAIN WITH A LAUGH AT HER MISHAP.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-32 JUST A LITTLE WAY FARTHER REPLIED THE SHAGGY MAN. A FEW MINUTES LATER HE CALLED TO THEM TO TURN ABOUT QUICKLY AND STEP FORWARD AND AS THEY OBEYED THE ORDER THEY FOUND THEMSELVES TREADING SOLID GROUND.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-33 THAT TASK IS WELL OVER OBSERVED THE SHAGGY MAN. IT'S A LITTLE TIRESOME TO WALK BACKWARD BUT THAT IS THE ONLY WAY TO PASS THIS PART OF THE ROAD WHICH HAS A TRICK OF SLIDING BACK AND CARRYING WITH IT ANYONE WHO IS WALKING UPON IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-34 WITH NEW COURAGE AND ENERGY THEY NOW TRUDGED FORWARD AND AFTER A TIME CAME TO A PLACE WHERE THE ROAD CUT THROUGH A LOW HILL LEAVING HIGH BANKS ON EITHER SIDE OF IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-35 THEY WERE TRAVELING ALONG THIS CUT TALKING TOGETHER WHEN THE SHAGGY MAN SEIZED SCRAPS WITH ONE ARM AND OJO WITH ANOTHER AND SHOUTED, STOP!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-36 WHAT'S WRONG NOW?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-37 THE PATCHWORK GIRL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-38 SEE THERE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-39 ANSWERED THE SHAGGY MAN POINTING WITH HIS FINGER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-40 DIRECTLY IN THE CENTER OF THE ROAD LAY A MOTIONLESS OBJECT THAT BRISTLED ALL OVER WITH SHARP QUILLS WHICH RESEMBLED ARROWS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-41 THE BODY WAS AS BIG AS A TEN BUSHEL BASKET BUT THE PROJECTING QUILLS MADE IT APPEAR TO BE FOUR TIMES BIGGER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-42 WELL WHAT OF IT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-43 ASKED SCRAPS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-44 THAT IS CHISS WHO CAUSES A LOT OF TROUBLE ALONG THIS ROAD WAS THE REPLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-45 CHISS!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-46 WHAT IS CHISS?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-47 I THINK IT IS MERELY AN OVERGROWN PORCUPINE BUT HERE IN OZ THEY CONSIDER CHISS AN EVIL SPIRIT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-48 HE'S DIFFERENT FROM A REG'LAR PORCUPINE BECAUSE HE CAN THROW HIS QUILLS IN ANY DIRECTION WHICH AN AMERICAN PORCUPINE CANNOT DO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-49 THAT'S WHAT MAKES OLD CHISS SO DANGEROUS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-50 IF WE GET TOO NEAR HE'LL FIRE THOSE QUILLS AT US AND HURT US BADLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-51 THEN WE WILL BE FOOLISH TO GET TOO NEAR SAID SCRAPS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-52 I'M NOT AFRAID DECLARED THE WOOZY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-53 THE CHISS IS COWARDLY I'M SURE AND IF IT EVER HEARD MY AWFUL TERRIBLE FRIGHTFUL GROWL IT WOULD BE SCARED STIFF.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-54 OH,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-55 CAN YOU GROWL?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-56 ASKED THE SHAGGY MAN. THAT IS THE ONLY FEROCIOUS THING ABOUT ME ASSERTED THE WOOZY WITH EVIDENT PRIDE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-57 MY GROWL MAKES AN EARTHQUAKE BLUSH AND THE THUNDER ASHAMED OF ITSELF.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-58 IF I GROWLED AT THAT CREATURE YOU CALL CHISS IT WOULD IMMEDIATELY THINK THE WORLD HAD CRACKED IN TWO AND BUMPED AGAINST THE SUN AND MOON AND THAT WOULD CAUSE THE MONSTER TO RUN AS FAR AND AS FAST AS ITS LEGS COULD CARRY IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-59 IN THAT CASE SAID THE SHAGGY MAN YOU ARE NOW ABLE TO DO US ALL A GREAT FAVOR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-60 PLEASE GROWL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-61 BUT YOU FORGET RETURNED THE WOOZY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-62 MY TREMENDOUS GROWL WOULD ALSO FRIGHTEN YOU AND IF YOU HAPPEN TO HAVE HEART DISEASE YOU MIGHT EXPIRE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-63 TRUE,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-64 BUT WE MUST TAKE THAT RISK DECIDED THE SHAGGY MAN BRAVELY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-65 BEING WARNED OF WHAT IS TO OCCUR WE MUST TRY TO BEAR THE TERRIFIC NOISE OF YOUR GROWL,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-66 BUT CHISS WON'T EXPECT IT AND IT WILL SCARE HIM AWAY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-67 THE WOOZY HESITATED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-68 I'M FOND OF YOU ALL AND I HATE TO SHOCK YOU IT SAID.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-69 NEVER MIND SAID OJO. YOU MAY BE MADE DEAF.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-70 IF SO WE WILL FORGIVE YOU.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-71 VERY WELL THEN SAID THE WOOZY IN A DETERMINED VOICE AND ADVANCED A FEW STEPS TOWARD THE GIANT PORCUPINE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-72 PAUSING TO LOOK BACK IT ASKED, ALL READY?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-73 ALL READY!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-74 THEY ANSWERED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-75 THEN COVER UP YOUR EARS AND BRACE YOURSELVES FIRMLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-76 NOW THEN LOOK OUT!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-77 THE WOOZY TURNED TOWARD CHISS OPENED WIDE ITS MOUTH AND SAID, QUEE EE EE EEK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-78 GO AHEAD AND GROWL SAID SCRAPS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-79 WHY I I DID GROWL!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-80 RETORTED THE WOOZY WHO SEEMED MUCH ASTONISHED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-81 WHAT THAT LITTLE SQUEAK?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-82 SHE CRIED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-83 IT IS THE MOST AWFUL GROWL THAT EVER WAS HEARD ON LAND OR SEA IN CAVERNS OR IN THE SKY PROTESTED THE WOOZY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-84 I WONDER YOU STOOD THE SHOCK SO WELL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-85 DIDN'T YOU FEEL THE GROUND TREMBLE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-86 I SUPPOSE CHISS IS NOW QUITE DEAD WITH FRIGHT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-87 THE SHAGGY MAN LAUGHED MERRILY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-88 POOR WOOZ!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-89 SAID HE,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-90 YOUR GROWL WOULDN'T SCARE A FLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-91 THE WOOZY SEEMED TO BE HUMILIATED AND SURPRISED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-92 IT HUNG ITS HEAD A MOMENT AS IF IN SHAME OR SORROW BUT THEN IT SAID WITH RENEWED CONFIDENCE, ANYHOW MY EYES CAN FLASH FIRE,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-93 AND GOOD FIRE TOO,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-94 GOOD ENOUGH TO SET FIRE TO A FENCE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-95 THAT IS TRUE DECLARED SCRAPS,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-96 I SAW IT DONE MYSELF.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-97 BUT YOUR FEROCIOUS GROWL ISN'T AS LOUD AS THE TICK OF A BEETLE OR ONE OF OJO'S SNORES WHEN HE'S FAST ASLEEP.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-98 PERHAPS SAID THE WOOZY HUMBLY I HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN ABOUT MY GROWL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-99 IT HAS ALWAYS SOUNDED VERY FEARFUL TO ME BUT THAT MAY HAVE BEEN BECAUSE IT WAS SO CLOSE TO MY EARS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-100 NEVER MIND OJO SAID SOOTHINGLY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-101 IT IS A GREAT TALENT TO BE ABLE TO FLASH FIRE FROM YOUR EYES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-102 NO ONE ELSE CAN DO THAT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-103 AS THEY STOOD HESITATING WHAT TO DO CHISS STIRRED AND SUDDENLY A SHOWER OF QUILLS CAME FLYING TOWARD THEM ALMOST FILLING THE AIR THEY WERE SO MANY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-104 SCRAPS REALIZED IN AN INSTANT THAT THEY HAD GONE TOO NEAR TO CHISS FOR SAFETY SO SHE SPRANG IN FRONT OF OJO AND SHIELDED HIM FROM THE DARTS WHICH STUCK THEIR POINTS INTO HER OWN BODY UNTIL SHE RESEMBLED ONE OF THOSE TARGETS THEY SHOOT ARROWS AT IN ARCHERY GAMES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-105 THE SHAGGY MAN DROPPED FLAT ON HIS FACE TO AVOID THE SHOWER BUT ONE QUILL STRUCK HIM IN THE LEG AND WENT FAR IN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-106 AS FOR THE GLASS CAT THE QUILLS RATTLED OFF HER BODY WITHOUT MAKING EVEN A SCRATCH AND THE SKIN OF THE WOOZY WAS SO THICK AND TOUGH THAT HE WAS NOT HURT AT ALL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-107 WHEN THE ATTACK WAS OVER THEY ALL RAN TO THE SHAGGY MAN WHO WAS MOANING AND GROANING AND SCRAPS PROMPTLY PULLED THE QUILL OUT OF HIS LEG.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-108 THEN UP HE JUMPED AND RAN OVER TO CHISS PUTTING HIS FOOT ON THE MONSTER'S NECK AND HOLDING IT A PRISONER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-109 THE BODY OF THE GREAT PORCUPINE WAS NOW AS SMOOTH AS LEATHER EXCEPT FOR THE HOLES WHERE THE QUILLS HAD BEEN FOR IT HAD SHOT EVERY SINGLE QUILL IN THAT ONE WICKED SHOWER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-110 LET ME GO!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-111 IT SHOUTED ANGRILY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-112 HOW DARE YOU PUT YOUR FOOT ON CHISS?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-113 I'M GOING TO DO WORSE THAN THAT OLD BOY REPLIED THE SHAGGY MAN. YOU HAVE ANNOYED TRAVELERS ON THIS ROAD LONG ENOUGH AND NOW I SHALL PUT AN END TO YOU.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-114 YOU CAN'T!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-115 RETURNED CHISS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-116 NOTHING CAN KILL ME AS YOU KNOW PERFECTLY WELL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-117 PERHAPS THAT IS TRUE SAID THE SHAGGY MAN IN A TONE OF DISAPPOINTMENT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-118 SEEMS TO ME I'VE BEEN TOLD BEFORE THAT YOU CAN'T BE KILLED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-119 BUT IF I LET YOU GO WHAT WILL YOU DO?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-120 PICK UP MY QUILLS AGAIN SAID CHISS IN A SULKY VOICE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-121 AND THEN SHOOT THEM AT MORE TRAVELERS?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-122 NO,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-123 THAT WON'T DO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-124 YOU MUST PROMISE ME TO STOP THROWING QUILLS AT PEOPLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-125 I WON'T PROMISE ANYTHING OF THE SORT DECLARED CHISS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-126 WHY NOT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-127 BECAUSE IT IS MY NATURE TO THROW QUILLS AND EVERY ANIMAL MUST DO WHAT NATURE INTENDS IT TO DO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-128 IT ISN'T FAIR FOR YOU TO BLAME ME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-129 IF IT WERE WRONG FOR ME TO THROW QUILLS THEN I WOULDN'T BE MADE WITH QUILLS TO THROW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-130 THE PROPER THING FOR YOU TO DO IS TO KEEP OUT OF MY WAY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-131 WHY THERE'S SOME SENSE IN THAT ARGUMENT ADMITTED THE SHAGGY MAN THOUGHTFULLY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-132 BUT PEOPLE WHO ARE STRANGERS AND DON'T KNOW YOU ARE HERE WON'T BE ABLE TO KEEP OUT OF YOUR WAY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-133 TELL YOU WHAT SAID SCRAPS WHO WAS TRYING TO PULL THE QUILLS OUT OF HER OWN BODY LET'S GATHER UP ALL THE QUILLS AND TAKE THEM AWAY WITH US,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-134 THEN OLD CHISS WON'T HAVE ANY LEFT TO THROW AT PEOPLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-135 AH THAT'S A CLEVER IDEA.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-136 YOU AND OJO MUST GATHER UP THE QUILLS WHILE I HOLD CHISS A PRISONER,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-137 FOR IF I LET HIM GO HE WILL GET SOME OF HIS QUILLS AND BE ABLE TO THROW THEM AGAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-138 SO SCRAPS AND OJO PICKED UP ALL THE QUILLS AND TIED THEM IN A BUNDLE SO THEY MIGHT EASILY BE CARRIED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-139 AFTER THIS THE SHAGGY MAN RELEASED CHISS AND LET HIM GO KNOWING THAT HE WAS HARMLESS TO INJURE ANYONE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-140 IT'S THE MEANEST TRICK I EVER HEARD OF MUTTERED THE PORCUPINE GLOOMILY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-141 HOW WOULD YOU LIKE IT SHAGGY MAN IF I TOOK ALL YOUR SHAGS AWAY FROM YOU?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-142 IF I THREW MY SHAGS AND HURT PEOPLE YOU WOULD BE WELCOME TO CAPTURE THEM WAS THE REPLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-143 THEN THEY WALKED ON AND LEFT CHISS STANDING IN THE ROAD SULLEN AND DISCONSOLATE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-144 THE SHAGGY MAN LIMPED AS HE WALKED FOR HIS WOUND STILL HURT HIM AND SCRAPS WAS MUCH ANNOYED BECAUSE THE QUILLS HAD LEFT A NUMBER OF SMALL HOLES IN HER PATCHES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-145 WHEN THEY CAME TO A FLAT STONE BY THE ROADSIDE THE SHAGGY MAN SAT DOWN TO REST AND THEN OJO OPENED HIS BASKET AND TOOK OUT THE BUNDLE OF CHARMS THE CROOKED MAGICIAN HAD GIVEN HIM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-146 I AM OJO THE UNLUCKY HE SAID OR WE WOULD NEVER HAVE MET THAT DREADFUL PORCUPINE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-147 BUT I WILL SEE IF I CAN FIND ANYTHING AMONG THESE CHARMS WHICH WILL CURE YOUR LEG.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-148 SOON HE DISCOVERED THAT ONE OF THE CHARMS WAS LABELLED, FOR FLESH WOUNDS AND THIS THE BOY SEPARATED FROM THE OTHERS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-149 IT WAS ONLY A BIT OF DRIED ROOT TAKEN FROM SOME UNKNOWN SHRUB BUT THE BOY RUBBED IT UPON THE WOUND MADE BY THE QUILL AND IN A FEW MOMENTS THE PLACE WAS HEALED ENTIRELY AND THE SHAGGY MAN'S LEG WAS AS GOOD AS EVER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-150 RUB IT ON THE HOLES IN MY PATCHES SUGGESTED SCRAPS AND OJO TRIED IT BUT WITHOUT ANY EFFECT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-151 THE CHARM YOU NEED IS A NEEDLE AND THREAD SAID THE SHAGGY MAN. BUT DO NOT WORRY MY DEAR,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-152 THOSE HOLES DO NOT LOOK BADLY AT ALL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-153 THEY'LL LET IN THE AIR AND I DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO THINK I'M AIRY OR THAT I'VE BEEN STUCK UP SAID THE PATCHWORK GIRL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-154 YOU WERE CERTAINLY STUCK UP UNTIL WE PULLED OUT THOSE QUILLS OBSERVED OJO WITH A LAUGH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-12-155 SO NOW THEY WENT ON AGAIN AND COMING PRESENTLY TO A POND OF MUDDY WATER THEY TIED A HEAVY STONE TO THE BUNDLE OF QUILLS AND SUNK IT TO THE BOTTOM OF THE POND TO AVOID CARRYING IT FARTHER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-01 CHAPTER THIRTEEN SCRAPS AND THE SCARECROW FROM HERE ON THE COUNTRY IMPROVED AND THE DESERT PLACES BEGAN TO GIVE WAY TO FERTILE SPOTS,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-02 STILL NO HOUSES WERE YET TO BE SEEN NEAR THE ROAD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-03 THERE WERE SOME HILLS WITH VALLEYS BETWEEN THEM AND ON REACHING THE TOP OF ONE OF THESE HILLS THE TRAVELERS FOUND BEFORE THEM A HIGH WALL RUNNING TO THE RIGHT AND THE LEFT AS FAR AS THEIR EYES COULD REACH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-04 IMMEDIATELY IN FRONT OF THEM WHERE THE WALL CROSSED THE ROADWAY STOOD A GATE HAVING STOUT IRON BARS THAT EXTENDED FROM TOP TO BOTTOM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-05 THEY FOUND ON COMING NEARER THAT THIS GATE WAS LOCKED WITH A GREAT PADLOCK RUSTY THROUGH LACK OF USE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-06 WELL SAID SCRAPS I GUESS WE'LL STOP HERE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-07 IT'S A GOOD GUESS REPLIED OJO. OUR WAY IS BARRED BY THIS GREAT WALL AND GATE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-08 IT LOOKS AS IF NO ONE HAD PASSED THROUGH IN MANY YEARS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-09 LOOKS ARE DECEIVING DECLARED THE SHAGGY MAN LAUGHING AT THEIR DISAPPOINTED FACES AND THIS BARRIER IS THE MOST DECEIVING THING IN ALL OZ. IT PREVENTS OUR GOING ANY FARTHER ANYHOW SAID SCRAPS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-10 THERE IS NO ONE TO MIND THE GATE AND LET PEOPLE THROUGH AND WE'VE NO KEY TO THE PADLOCK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-11 TRUE REPLIED OJO GOING A LITTLE NEARER TO PEEP THROUGH THE BARS OF THE GATE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-12 WHAT SHALL WE DO SHAGGY MAN?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-13 IF WE HAD WINGS WE MIGHT FLY OVER THE WALL BUT WE CANNOT CLIMB IT AND UNLESS WE GET TO THE EMERALD CITY I WON'T BE ABLE TO FIND THE THINGS TO RESTORE UNC NUNKIE TO LIFE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-14 ALL VERY TRUE ANSWERED THE SHAGGY MAN QUIETLY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-15 BUT I KNOW THIS GATE HAVING PASSED THROUGH IT MANY TIMES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-16 HOW?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-17 THEY ALL EAGERLY INQUIRED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-18 I'LL SHOW YOU HOW SAID HE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-19 HE STOOD OJO IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD AND PLACED SCRAPS JUST BEHIND HIM WITH HER PADDED HANDS ON HIS SHOULDERS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-20 AFTER THE PATCHWORK GIRL CAME THE WOOZY WHO HELD A PART OF HER SKIRT IN HIS MOUTH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-21 THEN LAST OF ALL WAS THE GLASS CAT HOLDING FAST TO THE WOOZY'S TAIL WITH HER GLASS JAWS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-22 NOW SAID THE SHAGGY MAN YOU MUST ALL SHUT YOUR EYES TIGHT AND KEEP THEM SHUT UNTIL I TELL YOU TO OPEN THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-23 I CAN'T OBJECTED SCRAPS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-24 MY EYES ARE BUTTONS AND THEY WON'T SHUT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-25 SO THE SHAGGY MAN TIED HIS RED HANDKERCHIEF OVER THE PATCHWORK GIRL'S EYES AND EXAMINED ALL THE OTHERS TO MAKE SURE THEY HAD THEIR EYES FAST SHUT AND COULD SEE NOTHING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-26 WHAT'S THE GAME ANYHOW BLIND MAN'S BUFF?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-27 ASKED SCRAPS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-28 KEEP QUIET!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-29 COMMANDED THE SHAGGY MAN STERNLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-30 ALL READY?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-31 THEN FOLLOW ME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-32 HE TOOK OJO'S HAND AND LED HIM FORWARD OVER THE ROAD OF YELLOW BRICKS TOWARD THE GATE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-33 HOLDING FAST TO ONE ANOTHER THEY ALL FOLLOWED IN A ROW EXPECTING EVERY MINUTE TO BUMP AGAINST THE IRON BARS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-34 THE SHAGGY MAN ALSO HAD HIS EYES CLOSED BUT MARCHED STRAIGHT AHEAD NEVERTHELESS AND AFTER HE HAD TAKEN ONE HUNDRED STEPS BY ACTUAL COUNT HE STOPPED AND SAID, NOW YOU MAY OPEN YOUR EYES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-35 THEY DID SO AND TO THEIR ASTONISHMENT FOUND THE WALL AND THE GATEWAY FAR BEHIND THEM WHILE IN FRONT THE FORMER BLUE COUNTRY OF THE MUNCHKINS HAD GIVEN WAY TO GREEN FIELDS WITH PRETTY FARM HOUSES SCATTERED AMONG THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-36 THAT WALL EXPLAINED THE SHAGGY MAN IS WHAT IS CALLED AN OPTICAL ILLUSION.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-37 IT IS QUITE REAL WHILE YOU HAVE YOUR EYES OPEN BUT IF YOU ARE NOT LOOKING AT IT THE BARRIER DOESN'T EXIST AT ALL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-38 IT'S THE SAME WAY WITH MANY OTHER EVILS IN LIFE,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-39 THEY SEEM TO EXIST AND YET IT'S ALL SEEMING AND NOT TRUE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-40 YOU WILL NOTICE THAT THE WALL OR WHAT WE THOUGHT WAS A WALL SEPARATES THE MUNCHKIN COUNTRY FROM THE GREEN COUNTRY THAT SURROUNDS THE EMERALD CITY WHICH LIES EXACTLY IN THE CENTER OF OZ. THERE ARE TWO ROADS OF YELLOW BRICKS THROUGH THE MUNCHKIN COUNTRY BUT THE ONE WE FOLLOWED IS THE BEST OF THE TWO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-41 DOROTHY ONCE TRAVELED THE OTHER WAY AND MET WITH MORE DANGERS THAN WE DID.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-42 BUT ALL OUR TROUBLES ARE OVER FOR THE PRESENT AS ANOTHER DAY'S JOURNEY WILL BRING US TO THE GREAT EMERALD CITY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-43 THEY WERE DELIGHTED TO KNOW THIS AND PROCEEDED WITH NEW COURAGE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-44 IN A COUPLE OF HOURS THEY STOPPED AT A FARMHOUSE WHERE THE PEOPLE WERE VERY HOSPITABLE AND INVITED THEM TO DINNER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-45 THE FARM FOLK REGARDED SCRAPS WITH MUCH CURIOSITY BUT NO GREAT ASTONISHMENT FOR THEY WERE ACCUSTOMED TO SEEING EXTRAORDINARY PEOPLE IN THE LAND OF OZ. THE WOMAN OF THIS HOUSE GOT HER NEEDLE AND THREAD AND SEWED UP THE HOLES MADE BY THE PORCUPINE QUILLS IN THE PATCHWORK GIRL'S BODY AFTER WHICH SCRAPS WAS ASSURED SHE LOOKED AS BEAUTIFUL AS EVER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-46 YOU OUGHT TO HAVE A HAT TO WEAR REMARKED THE WOMAN FOR THAT WOULD KEEP THE SUN FROM FADING THE COLORS OF YOUR FACE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-47 I HAVE SOME PATCHES AND SCRAPS PUT AWAY AND IF YOU WILL WAIT TWO OR THREE DAYS I'LL MAKE YOU A LOVELY HAT THAT WILL MATCH THE REST OF YOU.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-48 NEVER MIND THE HAT SAID SCRAPS SHAKING HER YARN BRAIDS,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-49 IT'S A KIND OFFER BUT WE CAN'T STOP.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-50 I CAN'T SEE THAT MY COLORS HAVE FADED A PARTICLE AS YET,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-51 CAN YOU?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-52 NOT MUCH REPLIED THE WOMAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-53 YOU ARE STILL VERY GORGEOUS IN SPITE OF YOUR LONG JOURNEY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-54 THE CHILDREN OF THE HOUSE WANTED TO KEEP THE GLASS CAT TO PLAY WITH SO BUNGLE WAS OFFERED A GOOD HOME IF SHE WOULD REMAIN,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-55 BUT THE CAT WAS TOO MUCH INTERESTED IN OJO'S ADVENTURES AND REFUSED TO STOP.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-56 CHILDREN ARE ROUGH PLAYMATES SHE REMARKED TO THE SHAGGY MAN AND ALTHOUGH THIS HOME IS MORE PLEASANT THAN THAT OF THE CROOKED MAGICIAN I FEAR I WOULD SOON BE SMASHED TO PIECES BY THE BOYS AND GIRLS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-57 AFTER THEY HAD RESTED THEMSELVES THEY RENEWED THEIR JOURNEY FINDING THE ROAD NOW SMOOTH AND PLEASANT TO WALK UPON AND THE COUNTRY GROWING MORE BEAUTIFUL THE NEARER THEY DREW TO THE EMERALD CITY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-58 BY AND BY OJO BEGAN TO WALK ON THE GREEN GRASS LOOKING CAREFULLY AROUND HIM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-59 WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO FIND?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-60 ASKED SCRAPS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-61 A SIX LEAVED CLOVER SAID HE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-62 DON'T DO THAT!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-63 EXCLAIMED THE SHAGGY MAN EARNESTLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-64 IT'S AGAINST THE LAW TO PICK A SIX LEAVED CLOVER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-65 YOU MUST WAIT UNTIL YOU GET OZMA'S CONSENT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-66 SHE WOULDN'T KNOW IT DECLARED THE BOY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-67 OZMA KNOWS MANY THINGS SAID THE SHAGGY MAN. IN HER ROOM IS A MAGIC PICTURE THAT SHOWS ANY SCENE IN THE LAND OF OZ WHERE STRANGERS OR TRAVELERS HAPPEN TO BE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-68 SHE MAY BE WATCHING THE PICTURE OF US EVEN NOW AND NOTICING EVERYTHING THAT WE DO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-69 DOES SHE ALWAYS WATCH THE MAGIC PICTURE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-70 ASKED OJO. NOT ALWAYS FOR SHE HAS MANY OTHER THINGS TO DO,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-71 BUT AS I SAID SHE MAY BE WATCHING US THIS VERY MINUTE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-72 I DON'T CARE SAID OJO IN AN OBSTINATE TONE OF VOICE,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-73 OZMA'S ONLY A GIRL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-74 THE SHAGGY MAN LOOKED AT HIM IN SURPRISE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-75 YOU OUGHT TO CARE FOR OZMA SAID HE IF YOU EXPECT TO SAVE YOUR UNCLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-76 FOR IF YOU DISPLEASE OUR POWERFUL RULER YOUR JOURNEY WILL SURELY PROVE A FAILURE,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-77 WHEREAS IF YOU MAKE A FRIEND OF OZMA SHE WILL GLADLY ASSIST YOU.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-78 AS FOR HER BEING A GIRL THAT IS ANOTHER REASON WHY YOU SHOULD OBEY HER LAWS IF YOU ARE COURTEOUS AND POLITE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-79 EVERYONE IN OZ LOVES OZMA AND HATES HER ENEMIES FOR SHE IS AS JUST AS SHE IS POWERFUL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-80 OJO SULKED A WHILE BUT FINALLY RETURNED TO THE ROAD AND KEPT AWAY FROM THE GREEN CLOVER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-81 THE BOY WAS MOODY AND BAD TEMPERED FOR AN HOUR OR TWO AFTERWARD BECAUSE HE COULD REALLY SEE NO HARM IN PICKING A SIX LEAVED CLOVER IF HE FOUND ONE AND IN SPITE OF WHAT THE SHAGGY MAN HAD SAID HE CONSIDERED OZMA'S LAW TO BE UNJUST.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-82 THEY PRESENTLY CAME TO A BEAUTIFUL GROVE OF TALL AND STATELY TREES THROUGH WHICH THE ROAD WOUND IN SHARP CURVES FIRST ONE WAY AND THEN ANOTHER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-83 AS THEY WERE WALKING THROUGH THIS GROVE THEY HEARD SOME ONE IN THE DISTANCE SINGING AND THE SOUNDS GREW NEARER AND NEARER UNTIL THEY COULD DISTINGUISH THE WORDS ALTHOUGH THE BEND IN THE ROAD STILL HID THE SINGER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-84 THE SONG WAS SOMETHING LIKE THIS, HERE'S TO THE HALE OLD BALE OF STRAW THAT'S CUT FROM THE WAVING GRAIN THE SWEETEST SIGHT MAN EVER SAW IN FOREST DELL OR PLAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-85 IT FILLS ME WITH A CRUNKLING JOY A STRAW STACK TO BEHOLD FOR THEN I PAD THIS LUCKY BOY WITH STRANDS OF YELLOW GOLD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-86 AH!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-87 EXCLAIMED THE SHAGGY MAN,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-88 HERE COMES MY FRIEND THE SCARECROW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-89 WHAT A LIVE SCARECROW?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-90 ASKED OJO. YES,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-91 THE ONE I TOLD YOU OF.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-92 HE'S A SPLENDID FELLOW AND VERY INTELLIGENT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-93 YOU'LL LIKE HIM I'M SURE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-94 JUST THEN THE FAMOUS SCARECROW OF OZ CAME AROUND THE BEND IN THE ROAD RIDING ASTRIDE A WOODEN SAWHORSE WHICH WAS SO SMALL THAT ITS RIDER'S LEGS NEARLY TOUCHED THE GROUND.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-95 THE SCARECROW WORE THE BLUE DRESS OF THE MUNCHKINS IN WHICH COUNTRY HE WAS MADE AND ON HIS HEAD WAS SET A PEAKED HAT WITH A FLAT BRIM TRIMMED WITH TINKLING BELLS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-96 A ROPE WAS TIED AROUND HIS WAIST TO HOLD HIM IN SHAPE FOR HE WAS STUFFED WITH STRAW IN EVERY PART OF HIM EXCEPT THE TOP OF HIS HEAD WHERE AT ONE TIME THE WIZARD OF OZ HAD PLACED SAWDUST MIXED WITH NEEDLES AND PINS TO SHARPEN HIS WITS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-97 THE HEAD ITSELF WAS MERELY A BAG OF CLOTH FASTENED TO THE BODY AT THE NECK AND ON THE FRONT OF THIS BAG WAS PAINTED THE FACE EARS EYES NOSE AND MOUTH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-98 THE SCARECROW'S FACE WAS VERY INTERESTING FOR IT BORE A COMICAL AND YET WINNING EXPRESSION ALTHOUGH ONE EYE WAS A BIT LARGER THAN THE OTHER AND EARS WERE NOT MATES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-99 THE MUNCHKIN FARMER WHO HAD MADE THE SCARECROW HAD NEGLECTED TO SEW HIM TOGETHER WITH CLOSE STITCHES AND THEREFORE SOME OF THE STRAW WITH WHICH HE WAS STUFFED WAS INCLINED TO STICK OUT BETWEEN THE SEAMS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-100 HIS HANDS CONSISTED OF PADDED WHITE GLOVES WITH THE FINGERS LONG AND RATHER LIMP AND ON HIS FEET HE WORE MUNCHKIN BOOTS OF BLUE LEATHER WITH BROAD TURNS AT THE TOPS OF THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-101 THE SAWHORSE WAS ALMOST AS CURIOUS AS ITS RIDER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-102 IT HAD BEEN RUDELY MADE IN THE BEGINNING TO SAW LOGS UPON SO THAT ITS BODY WAS A SHORT LENGTH OF A LOG AND ITS LEGS WERE STOUT BRANCHES FITTED INTO FOUR HOLES MADE IN THE BODY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-103 THE TAIL WAS FORMED BY A SMALL BRANCH THAT HAD BEEN LEFT ON THE LOG WHILE THE HEAD WAS A GNARLED BUMP ON ONE END OF THE BODY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-104 TWO KNOTS OF WOOD FORMED THE EYES AND THE MOUTH WAS A GASH CHOPPED IN THE LOG.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-105 WHEN THE SAWHORSE FIRST CAME TO LIFE IT HAD NO EARS AT ALL AND SO COULD NOT HEAR,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-106 BUT THE BOY WHO THEN OWNED HIM HAD WHITTLED TWO EARS OUT OF BARK AND STUCK THEM IN THE HEAD AFTER WHICH THE SAWHORSE HEARD VERY DISTINCTLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-107 THIS QUEER WOODEN HORSE WAS A GREAT FAVORITE WITH PRINCESS OZMA WHO HAD CAUSED THE BOTTOMS OF ITS LEGS TO BE SHOD WITH PLATES OF GOLD SO THE WOOD WOULD NOT WEAR AWAY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-108 ITS SADDLE WAS MADE OF CLOTH OF GOLD RICHLY ENCRUSTED WITH PRECIOUS GEMS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-109 IT HAD NEVER WORN A BRIDLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-110 AS THE SCARECROW CAME IN SIGHT OF THE PARTY OF TRAVELERS HE REINED IN HIS WOODEN STEED AND DISMOUNTED GREETING THE SHAGGY MAN WITH A SMILING NOD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-111 THEN HE TURNED TO STARE AT THE PATCHWORK GIRL IN WONDER WHILE SHE IN TURN STARED AT HIM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-112 SHAGS HE WHISPERED DRAWING THE SHAGGY MAN ASIDE PAT ME INTO SHAPE THERE'S A GOOD FELLOW!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-113 WHILE HIS FRIEND PUNCHED AND PATTED THE SCARECROW'S BODY TO SMOOTH OUT THE HUMPS SCRAPS TURNED TO OJO AND WHISPERED, ROLL ME OUT PLEASE,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-114 I'VE SAGGED DOWN DREADFULLY FROM WALKING SO MUCH AND MEN LIKE TO SEE A STATELY FIGURE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-115 SHE THEN FELL UPON THE GROUND AND THE BOY ROLLED HER BACK AND FORTH LIKE A ROLLING PIN UNTIL THE COTTON HAD FILLED ALL THE SPACES IN HER PATCHWORK COVERING AND THE BODY HAD LENGTHENED TO ITS FULLEST EXTENT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-116 SCRAPS AND THE SCARECROW BOTH FINISHED THEIR HASTY TOILETS AT THE SAME TIME AND AGAIN THEY FACED EACH OTHER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-117 ALLOW ME MISS PATCHWORK SAID THE SHAGGY MAN TO PRESENT MY FRIEND THE RIGHT ROYAL SCARECROW OF OZ. SCARECROW THIS IS MISS SCRAPS PATCHES,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-118 SCRAPS THIS IS THE SCARECROW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-119 SCARECROW SCRAPS,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-120 SCRAPS SCARECROW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-121 THEY BOTH BOWED WITH MUCH DIGNITY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-122 FORGIVE ME FOR STARING SO RUDELY SAID THE SCARECROW BUT YOU ARE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL SIGHT MY EYES HAVE EVER BEHELD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-123 THAT IS A HIGH COMPLIMENT FROM ONE WHO IS HIMSELF SO BEAUTIFUL MURMURED SCRAPS CASTING DOWN HER SUSPENDER BUTTON EYES BY LOWERING HER HEAD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-124 BUT TELL ME GOOD SIR ARE YOU NOT A TRIFLE LUMPY?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-125 YES OF COURSE,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-126 THAT'S MY STRAW YOU KNOW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-127 IT BUNCHES UP SOMETIMES IN SPITE OF ALL MY EFFORTS TO KEEP IT EVEN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-128 DOESN'T YOUR STRAW EVER BUNCH?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-129 OH I'M STUFFED WITH COTTON SAID SCRAPS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-130 IT NEVER BUNCHES BUT IT'S INCLINED TO PACK DOWN AND MAKE ME SAG.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-131 BUT COTTON IS A HIGH GRADE STUFFING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-132 I MAY SAY IT IS EVEN MORE STYLISH NOT TO SAY ARISTOCRATIC THAN STRAW SAID THE SCARECROW POLITELY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-133 STILL IT IS BUT PROPER THAT ONE SO ENTRANCINGLY LOVELY SHOULD HAVE THE BEST STUFFING THERE IS GOING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-134 I ER I'M SO GLAD I'VE MET YOU MISS SCRAPS!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-135 INTRODUCE US AGAIN SHAGGY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-136 ONCE IS ENOUGH REPLIED THE SHAGGY MAN LAUGHING AT HIS FRIEND'S ENTHUSIASM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-137 THEN TELL ME WHERE YOU FOUND HER AND DEAR ME WHAT A QUEER CAT!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-138 WHAT ARE YOU MADE OF GELATINE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-139 PURE GLASS ANSWERED THE CAT PROUD TO HAVE ATTRACTED THE SCARECROW'S ATTENTION.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-140 I AM MUCH MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN THE PATCHWORK GIRL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-141 I'M TRANSPARENT AND SCRAPS ISN'T,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-142 I'VE PINK BRAINS YOU CAN SEE EM WORK,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-143 AND I'VE A RUBY HEART FINELY POLISHED WHILE SCRAPS HASN'T ANY HEART AT ALL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-144 NO MORE HAVE I SAID THE SCARECROW SHAKING HANDS WITH SCRAPS AS IF TO CONGRATULATE HER ON THE FACT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-145 I'VE A FRIEND THE TIN WOODMAN WHO HAS A HEART BUT I FIND I GET ALONG PRETTY WELL WITHOUT ONE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-146 AND SO WELL WELL!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-147 HERE'S A LITTLE MUNCHKIN BOY TOO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-148 SHAKE HANDS MY LITTLE MAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-149 HOW ARE YOU?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-150 OJO PLACED HIS HAND IN THE FLABBY STUFFED GLOVE THAT SERVED THE SCARECROW FOR A HAND AND THE SCARECROW PRESSED IT SO CORDIALLY THAT THE STRAW IN HIS GLOVE CRACKLED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-151 MEANTIME THE WOOZY HAD APPROACHED THE SAWHORSE AND BEGUN TO SNIFF AT IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-152 THE SAWHORSE RESENTED THIS FAMILIARITY AND WITH A SUDDEN KICK POUNDED THE WOOZY SQUARELY ON ITS HEAD WITH ONE GOLD SHOD FOOT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-153 TAKE THAT YOU MONSTER!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-154 IT CRIED ANGRILY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-155 THE WOOZY NEVER EVEN WINKED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-156 TO BE SURE HE SAID,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-157 TAKE ANYTHING I HAVE TO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-158 BUT DON'T MAKE ME ANGRY YOU WOODEN BEAST OR MY EYES WILL FLASH FIRE AND BURN YOU UP.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-159 THE SAWHORSE ROLLED ITS KNOT EYES WICKEDLY AND KICKED AGAIN BUT THE WOOZY TROTTED AWAY AND SAID TO THE SCARECROW, WHAT A SWEET DISPOSITION THAT CREATURE HAS!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-160 I ADVISE YOU TO CHOP IT UP FOR KINDLING WOOD AND USE ME TO RIDE UPON.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-161 MY BACK IS FLAT AND YOU CAN'T FALL OFF.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-162 I THINK THE TROUBLE IS THAT YOU HAVEN'T BEEN PROPERLY INTRODUCED SAID THE SCARECROW REGARDING THE WOOZY WITH MUCH WONDER FOR HE HAD NEVER SEEN SUCH A QUEER ANIMAL BEFORE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-163 THE SAWHORSE IS THE FAVORITE STEED OF PRINCESS OZMA THE RULER OF THE LAND OF OZ AND HE LIVES IN A STABLE DECORATED WITH PEARLS AND EMERALDS AT THE REAR OF THE ROYAL PALACE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-164 HE IS SWIFT AS THE WIND UNTIRING AND IS KIND TO HIS FRIENDS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-165 ALL THE PEOPLE OF OZ RESPECT THE SAWHORSE HIGHLY AND WHEN I VISIT OZMA SHE SOMETIMES ALLOWS ME TO RIDE HIM AS I AM DOING TO DAY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-166 NOW YOU KNOW WHAT AN IMPORTANT PERSONAGE THE SAWHORSE IS AND IF SOME ONE PERHAPS YOURSELF WILL TELL ME YOUR NAME YOUR RANK AND STATION AND YOUR HISTORY IT WILL GIVE ME PLEASURE TO RELATE THEM TO THE SAWHORSE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-167 THIS WILL LEAD TO MUTUAL RESPECT AND FRIENDSHIP.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-168 THE WOOZY WAS SOMEWHAT ABASHED BY THIS SPEECH AND DID NOT KNOW HOW TO REPLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-169 BUT OJO SAID, THIS SQUARE BEAST IS CALLED THE WOOZY AND HE ISN'T OF MUCH IMPORTANCE EXCEPT THAT HE HAS THREE HAIRS GROWING ON THE TIP OF HIS TAIL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-170 THE SCARECROW LOOKED AND SAW THAT THIS WAS TRUE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-171 BUT SAID HE IN A PUZZLED WAY WHAT MAKES THOSE THREE HAIRS IMPORTANT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-172 THE SHAGGY MAN HAS THOUSANDS OF HAIRS BUT NO ONE HAS EVER ACCUSED HIM OF BEING IMPORTANT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-173 SO OJO RELATED THE SAD STORY OF UNC NUNKIE'S TRANSFORMATION INTO A MARBLE STATUE AND TOLD HOW HE HAD SET OUT TO FIND THE THINGS THE CROOKED MAGICIAN WANTED IN ORDER TO MAKE A CHARM THAT WOULD RESTORE HIS UNCLE TO LIFE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-174 ONE OF THE REQUIREMENTS WAS THREE HAIRS FROM A WOOZY'S TAIL BUT NOT BEING ABLE TO PULL OUT THE HAIRS THEY HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO TAKE THE WOOZY WITH THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-175 THE SCARECROW LOOKED GRAVE AS HE LISTENED AND HE SHOOK HIS HEAD SEVERAL TIMES AS IF IN DISAPPROVAL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-176 WE MUST SEE OZMA ABOUT THIS MATTER HE SAID.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-177 THAT CROOKED MAGICIAN IS BREAKING THE LAW BY PRACTICING MAGIC WITHOUT A LICENSE AND I'M NOT SURE OZMA WILL ALLOW HIM TO RESTORE YOUR UNCLE TO LIFE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-178 ALREADY I HAVE WARNED THE BOY OF THAT DECLARED THE SHAGGY MAN. AT THIS OJO BEGAN TO CRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-179 EXCLAIMED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-180 I KNOW HOW HE CAN BE RESTORED TO LIFE AND I'M GOING TO DO IT OZMA OR NO OZMA!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-181 WHAT RIGHT HAS THIS GIRL RULER TO KEEP MY UNC NUNKIE A STATUE FOREVER?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-182 DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT JUST NOW ADVISED THE SCARECROW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-183 GO ON TO THE EMERALD CITY AND WHEN YOU REACH IT HAVE THE SHAGGY MAN TAKE YOU TO SEE DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-184 TELL HER YOUR STORY AND I'M SURE SHE WILL HELP YOU.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-185 DOROTHY IS OZMA'S BEST FRIEND AND IF YOU CAN WIN HER TO YOUR SIDE YOUR UNCLE IS PRETTY SAFE TO LIVE AGAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-186 THEN HE TURNED TO THE WOOZY AND SAID, I'M AFRAID YOU ARE NOT IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO BE INTRODUCED TO THE SAWHORSE AFTER ALL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-187 I'M A BETTER BEAST THAN HE IS RETORTED THE WOOZY INDIGNANTLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-188 MY EYES CAN FLASH FIRE AND HIS CAN'T.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-189 IS THIS TRUE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-190 INQUIRED THE SCARECROW TURNING TO THE MUNCHKIN BOY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-191 YES SAID OJO AND TOLD HOW THE WOOZY HAD SET FIRE TO THE FENCE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-192 HAVE YOU ANY OTHER ACCOMPLISHMENTS?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-193 ASKED THE SCARECROW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-194 I HAVE A MOST TERRIBLE GROWL THAT IS SOMETIMES SAID THE WOOZY AS SCRAPS LAUGHED MERRILY AND THE SHAGGY MAN SMILED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-195 BUT THE PATCHWORK GIRL'S LAUGH MADE THE SCARECROW FORGET ALL ABOUT THE WOOZY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-196 HE SAID TO HER, WHAT AN ADMIRABLE YOUNG LADY YOU ARE AND WHAT JOLLY GOOD COMPANY!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-197 WE MUST BE BETTER ACQUAINTED FOR NEVER BEFORE HAVE I MET A GIRL WITH SUCH EXQUISITE COLORING OR SUCH NATURAL ARTLESS MANNERS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-198 NO WONDER THEY CALL YOU THE WISE SCARECROW REPLIED SCRAPS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-199 WHEN YOU ARRIVE AT THE EMERALD CITY I WILL SEE YOU AGAIN CONTINUED THE SCARECROW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-200 JUST NOW I AM GOING TO CALL UPON AN OLD FRIEND AN ORDINARY YOUNG LADY NAMED JINJUR WHO HAS PROMISED TO REPAINT MY LEFT EAR FOR ME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-201 YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED THAT THE PAINT ON MY LEFT EAR HAS PEELED OFF AND FADED WHICH AFFECTS MY HEARING ON THAT SIDE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-202 JINJUR ALWAYS FIXES ME UP WHEN I GET WEATHER WORN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-203 WHEN DO YOU EXPECT TO RETURN TO THE EMERALD CITY?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-204 ASKED THE SHAGGY MAN. I'LL BE THERE THIS EVENING FOR I'M ANXIOUS TO HAVE A LONG TALK WITH MISS SCRAPS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-205 HOW IS IT SAWHORSE,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-206 ARE YOU EQUAL TO A SWIFT RUN?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-207 ANYTHING THAT SUITS YOU SUITS ME RETURNED THE WOODEN HORSE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-13-208 SO THE SCARECROW MOUNTED TO THE JEWELED SADDLE AND WAVED HIS HAT WHEN THE SAWHORSE DARTED AWAY SO SWIFTLY THAT THEY WERE OUT OF SIGHT IN AN INSTANT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-01 CHAPTER FOURTEEN OJO BREAKS THE LAW WHAT A QUEER MAN REMARKED THE MUNCHKIN BOY WHEN THE PARTY HAD RESUMED ITS JOURNEY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-02 AND SO NICE AND POLITE ADDED SCRAPS BOBBING HER HEAD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-03 I THINK HE IS THE HANDSOMEST MAN I'VE SEEN SINCE I CAME TO LIFE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-04 HANDSOME IS AS HANDSOME DOES QUOTED THE SHAGGY MAN,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-05 BUT WE MUST ADMIT THAT NO LIVING SCARECROW IS HANDSOMER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-06 THE CHIEF MERIT OF MY FRIEND IS THAT HE IS A GREAT THINKER AND IN OZ IT IS CONSIDERED GOOD POLICY TO FOLLOW HIS ADVICE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-07 I DIDN'T NOTICE ANY BRAINS IN HIS HEAD OBSERVED THE GLASS CAT. YOU CAN'T SEE EM WORK BUT THEY'RE THERE ALL RIGHT DECLARED THE SHAGGY MAN. I HADN'T MUCH CONFIDENCE IN HIS BRAINS MYSELF WHEN FIRST I CAME TO OZ FOR A HUMBUG WIZARD GAVE THEM TO HIM,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-08 BUT I WAS SOON CONVINCED THAT THE SCARECROW IS REALLY WISE,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-09 AND UNLESS HIS BRAINS MAKE HIM SO SUCH WISDOM IS UNACCOUNTABLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-10 IS THE WIZARD OF OZ A HUMBUG?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-11 ASKED OJO. NOT NOW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-12 HE WAS ONCE BUT HE HAS REFORMED AND NOW ASSISTS GLINDA THE GOOD WHO IS THE ROYAL SORCERESS OF OZ AND THE ONLY ONE LICENSED TO PRACTICE MAGIC OR SORCERY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-13 GLINDA HAS TAUGHT OUR OLD WIZARD A GOOD MANY CLEVER THINGS SO HE IS NO LONGER A HUMBUG.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-14 THEY WALKED A LITTLE WHILE IN SILENCE AND THEN OJO SAID, IF OZMA FORBIDS THE CROOKED MAGICIAN TO RESTORE UNC NUNKIE TO LIFE WHAT SHALL I DO?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-15 THE SHAGGY MAN SHOOK HIS HEAD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-16 IN THAT CASE YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING HE SAID.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-17 BUT DON'T BE DISCOURAGED YET.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-18 WE WILL GO TO PRINCESS DOROTHY AND TELL HER YOUR TROUBLES AND THEN WE WILL LET HER TALK TO OZMA.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-19 DOROTHY HAS THE KINDEST LITTLE HEART IN THE WORLD AND SHE HAS BEEN THROUGH SO MANY TROUBLES HERSELF THAT SHE IS SURE TO SYMPATHIZE WITH YOU.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-20 IS DOROTHY THE LITTLE GIRL WHO CAME HERE FROM KANSAS?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-21 ASKED THE BOY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-22 YES. IN KANSAS SHE WAS DOROTHY GALE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-23 I USED TO KNOW HER THERE AND SHE BROUGHT ME TO THE LAND OF OZ. BUT NOW OZMA HAS MADE HER A PRINCESS AND DOROTHY'S AUNT EM AND UNCLE HENRY ARE HERE TOO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-24 HERE THE SHAGGY MAN UTTERED A LONG SIGH AND THEN HE CONTINUED, IT'S A QUEER COUNTRY THIS LAND OF OZ,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-25 BUT I LIKE IT NEVERTHELESS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-26 WHAT IS QUEER ABOUT IT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-27 ASKED SCRAPS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-28 YOU FOR INSTANCE SAID HE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-29 DID YOU SEE NO GIRLS AS BEAUTIFUL AS I AM IN YOUR OWN COUNTRY?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-30 SHE INQUIRED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-31 NONE WITH THE SAME GORGEOUS VARIEGATED BEAUTY HE CONFESSED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-32 IN AMERICA A GIRL STUFFED WITH COTTON WOULDN'T BE ALIVE NOR WOULD ANYONE THINK OF MAKING A GIRL OUT OF A PATCHWORK QUILT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-33 WHAT A QUEER COUNTRY AMERICA MUST BE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-34 SHE EXCLAIMED IN GREAT SURPRISE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-35 THE SCARECROW WHOM YOU SAY IS WISE TOLD ME I AM THE MOST BEAUTIFUL CREATURE HE HAS EVER SEEN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-36 I KNOW,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-37 AND PERHAPS YOU ARE FROM A SCARECROW POINT OF VIEW REPLIED THE SHAGGY MAN,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-38 BUT WHY HE SMILED AS HE SAID IT SCRAPS COULD NOT IMAGINE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-39 AS THEY DREW NEARER TO THE EMERALD CITY THE TRAVELERS WERE FILLED WITH ADMIRATION FOR THE SPLENDID SCENERY THEY BEHELD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-40 HANDSOME HOUSES STOOD ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ROAD AND EACH HAD A GREEN LAWN BEFORE IT AS WELL AS A PRETTY FLOWER GARDEN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-41 IN ANOTHER HOUR SAID THE SHAGGY MAN WE SHALL COME IN SIGHT OF THE WALLS OF THE ROYAL CITY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-42 HE WAS WALKING AHEAD WITH SCRAPS AND BEHIND THEM CAME THE WOOZY AND THE GLASS CAT. OJO HAD LAGGED BEHIND FOR IN SPITE OF THE WARNINGS HE HAD RECEIVED THE BOY'S EYES WERE FASTENED ON THE CLOVER THAT BORDERED THE ROAD OF YELLOW BRICKS AND HE WAS EAGER TO DISCOVER IF SUCH A THING AS A SIX LEAVED CLOVER REALLY EXISTED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-43 SUDDENLY HE STOPPED SHORT AND BENT OVER TO EXAMINE THE GROUND MORE CLOSELY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-44 YES,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-45 HERE AT LAST WAS A CLOVER WITH SIX SPREADING LEAVES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-46 HE COUNTED THEM CAREFULLY TO MAKE SURE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-47 IN AN INSTANT HIS HEART LEAPED WITH JOY FOR THIS WAS ONE OF THE IMPORTANT THINGS HE HAD COME FOR ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WOULD RESTORE DEAR UNC NUNKIE TO LIFE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-48 HE GLANCED AHEAD AND SAW THAT NONE OF HIS COMPANIONS WAS LOOKING BACK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-49 NEITHER WERE ANY OTHER PEOPLE ABOUT FOR IT WAS MIDWAY BETWEEN TWO HOUSES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-50 THE TEMPTATION WAS TOO STRONG TO BE RESISTED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-51 I MIGHT SEARCH FOR WEEKS AND WEEKS AND NEVER FIND ANOTHER SIX LEAVED CLOVER HE TOLD HIMSELF AND QUICKLY PLUCKING THE STEM FROM THE PLANT HE PLACED THE PRIZED CLOVER IN HIS BASKET COVERING IT WITH THE OTHER THINGS HE CARRIED THERE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-52 THEN TRYING TO LOOK AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED HE HURRIED FORWARD AND OVERTOOK HIS COMRADES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-53 THE EMERALD CITY WHICH IS THE MOST SPLENDID AS WELL AS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL CITY IN ANY FAIRYLAND IS SURROUNDED BY A HIGH THICK WALL OF GREEN MARBLE POLISHED SMOOTH AND SET WITH GLISTENING EMERALDS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-54 THERE ARE FOUR GATES ONE FACING THE MUNCHKIN COUNTRY ONE FACING THE COUNTRY OF THE WINKIES ONE FACING THE COUNTRY OF THE QUADLINGS AND ONE FACING THE COUNTRY OF THE GILLIKINS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-55 THE EMERALD CITY LIES DIRECTLY IN THE CENTER OF THESE FOUR IMPORTANT COUNTRIES OF OZ. THE GATES HAD BARS OF PURE GOLD AND ON EITHER SIDE OF EACH GATEWAY WERE BUILT HIGH TOWERS FROM WHICH FLOATED GAY BANNERS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-56 OTHER TOWERS WERE SET AT DISTANCES ALONG THE WALLS WHICH WERE BROAD ENOUGH FOR FOUR PEOPLE TO WALK ABREAST UPON.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-57 THIS ENCLOSURE ALL GREEN AND GOLD AND GLITTERING WITH PRECIOUS GEMS WAS INDEED A WONDERFUL SIGHT TO GREET OUR TRAVELERS WHO FIRST OBSERVED IT FROM THE TOP OF A LITTLE HILL,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-58 BUT BEYOND THE WALL WAS THE VAST CITY IT SURROUNDED AND HUNDREDS OF JEWELED SPIRES DOMES AND MINARETS FLAUNTING FLAGS AND BANNERS REARED THEIR CRESTS FAR ABOVE THE TOWERS OF THE GATEWAYS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-59 IN THE CENTER OF THE CITY OUR FRIENDS COULD SEE THE TOPS OF MANY MAGNIFICENT TREES SOME NEARLY AS TALL AS THE SPIRES OF THE BUILDINGS AND THE SHAGGY MAN TOLD THEM THAT THESE TREES WERE IN THE ROYAL GARDENS OF PRINCESS OZMA.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-60 THEY STOOD A LONG TIME ON THE HILLTOP FEASTING THEIR EYES ON THE SPLENDOR OF THE EMERALD CITY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-61 WHEE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-62 EXCLAIMED SCRAPS CLASPING HER PADDED HANDS IN ECSTACY THAT'LL DO FOR ME TO LIVE IN ALL RIGHT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-63 NO MORE OF THE MUNCHKIN COUNTRY FOR THESE PATCHES AND NO MORE OF THE CROOKED MAGICIAN!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-64 WHY YOU BELONG TO DOCTOR PIPT REPLIED OJO LOOKING AT HER IN AMAZEMENT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-65 YOU WERE MADE FOR A SERVANT SCRAPS SO YOU ARE PERSONAL PROPERTY AND NOT YOUR OWN MISTRESS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-66 BOTHER DOCTOR PIPT!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-67 IF HE WANTS ME LET HIM COME HERE AND GET ME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-68 I'LL NOT GO BACK TO HIS DEN OF MY OWN ACCORD,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-69 THAT'S CERTAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-70 ONLY ONE PLACE IN THE LAND OF OZ IS FIT TO LIVE IN AND THAT'S THE EMERALD CITY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-71 IT'S LOVELY!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-72 IT'S ALMOST AS BEAUTIFUL AS I AM OJO. IN THIS COUNTRY REMARKED THE SHAGGY MAN PEOPLE LIVE WHEREVER OUR RULER TELLS THEM TO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-73 IT WOULDN'T DO TO HAVE EVERYONE LIVE IN THE EMERALD CITY YOU KNOW FOR SOME MUST PLOW THE LAND AND RAISE GRAINS AND FRUITS AND VEGETABLES WHILE OTHERS CHOP WOOD IN THE FORESTS OR FISH IN THE RIVERS OR HERD THE SHEEP AND THE CATTLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-74 POOR THINGS!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-75 SAID SCRAPS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-76 I'M NOT SURE THEY ARE NOT HAPPIER THAN THE CITY PEOPLE REPLIED THE SHAGGY MAN. THERE'S A FREEDOM AND INDEPENDENCE IN COUNTRY LIFE THAT NOT EVEN THE EMERALD CITY CAN GIVE ONE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-77 I KNOW THAT LOTS OF THE CITY PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO GET BACK TO THE LAND.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-78 THE SCARECROW LIVES IN THE COUNTRY AND SO DO THE TIN WOODMAN AND JACK PUMPKINHEAD,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-79 YET ALL THREE WOULD BE WELCOME TO LIVE IN OZMA'S PALACE IF THEY CARED TO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-80 TOO MUCH SPLENDOR BECOMES TIRESOME YOU KNOW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-81 BUT IF WE'RE TO REACH THE EMERALD CITY BEFORE SUNDOWN WE MUST HURRY FOR IT IS YET A LONG WAY OFF.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-82 THE ENTRANCING SIGHT OF THE CITY HAD PUT NEW ENERGY INTO THEM ALL AND THEY HURRIED FORWARD WITH LIGHTER STEPS THAN BEFORE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-83 THERE WAS MUCH TO INTEREST THEM ALONG THE ROADWAY FOR THE HOUSES WERE NOW SET MORE CLOSELY TOGETHER AND THEY MET A GOOD MANY PEOPLE WHO WERE COMING OR GOING FROM ONE PLACE OR ANOTHER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-84 ALL THESE SEEMED HAPPY FACED PLEASANT PEOPLE WHO NODDED GRACIOUSLY TO THE STRANGERS AS THEY PASSED AND EXCHANGED WORDS OF GREETING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-85 AT LAST THEY REACHED THE GREAT GATEWAY JUST AS THE SUN WAS SETTING AND ADDING ITS RED GLOW TO THE GLITTER OF THE EMERALDS ON THE GREEN WALLS AND SPIRES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-86 SOMEWHERE INSIDE THE CITY A BAND COULD BE HEARD PLAYING SWEET MUSIC,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-87 A SOFT SUBDUED HUM AS OF MANY VOICES REACHED THEIR EARS,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-88 FROM THE NEIGHBORING YARDS CAME THE LOW MOOING OF COWS WAITING TO BE MILKED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-89 THEY WERE ALMOST AT THE GATE WHEN THE GOLDEN BARS SLID BACK AND A TALL SOLDIER STEPPED OUT AND FACED THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-90 OJO THOUGHT HE HAD NEVER SEEN SO TALL A MAN BEFORE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-91 THE SOLDIER WORE A HANDSOME GREEN AND GOLD UNIFORM WITH A TALL HAT IN WHICH WAS A WAVING PLUME AND HE HAD A BELT THICKLY ENCRUSTED WITH JEWELS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-92 BUT THE MOST PECULIAR THING ABOUT HIM WAS HIS LONG GREEN BEARD WHICH FELL FAR BELOW HIS WAIST AND PERHAPS MADE HIM SEEM TALLER THAN HE REALLY WAS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-93 HALT!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-94 SAID THE SOLDIER WITH THE GREEN WHISKERS NOT IN A STERN VOICE BUT RATHER IN A FRIENDLY TONE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-95 THEY HALTED BEFORE HE SPOKE AND STOOD LOOKING AT HIM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-96 GOOD EVENING COLONEL SAID THE SHAGGY MAN. WHAT'S THE NEWS SINCE I LEFT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-97 ANYTHING IMPORTANT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-98 BILLINA HAS HATCHED OUT THIRTEEN NEW CHICKENS REPLIED THE SOLDIER WITH THE GREEN WHISKERS AND THEY'RE THE CUTEST LITTLE FLUFFY YELLOW BALLS YOU EVER SAW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-99 THE YELLOW HEN IS MIGHTY PROUD OF THOSE CHILDREN I CAN TELL YOU.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-100 SHE HAS A RIGHT TO BE AGREED THE SHAGGY MAN. LET ME SEE,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-101 THAT'S ABOUT SEVEN THOUSAND CHICKS SHE HAS HATCHED OUT,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-102 ISN'T IT GENERAL?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-103 THAT AT LEAST WAS THE REPLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-104 YOU WILL HAVE TO VISIT BILLINA AND CONGRATULATE HER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-105 IT WILL GIVE ME PLEASURE TO DO THAT SAID THE SHAGGY MAN. BUT YOU WILL OBSERVE THAT I HAVE BROUGHT SOME STRANGERS HOME WITH ME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-106 I AM GOING TO TAKE THEM TO SEE DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-107 ONE MOMENT PLEASE SAID THE SOLDIER BARRING THEIR WAY AS THEY STARTED TO ENTER THE GATE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-108 I AM ON DUTY AND I HAVE ORDERS TO EXECUTE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-109 IS ANYONE IN YOUR PARTY NAMED OJO THE UNLUCKY?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-110 WHY THAT'S ME!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-111 CRIED OJO ASTONISHED AT HEARING HIS NAME ON THE LIPS OF A STRANGER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-112 THE SOLDIER WITH THE GREEN WHISKERS NODDED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-113 I THOUGHT SO SAID HE AND I AM SORRY TO ANNOUNCE THAT IT IS MY PAINFUL DUTY TO ARREST YOU.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-114 ARREST ME!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-115 EXCLAIMED THE BOY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-116 WHAT FOR?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-117 I HAVEN'T LOOKED TO SEE ANSWERED THE SOLDIER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-118 THEN HE DREW A PAPER FROM HIS BREAST POCKET AND GLANCED AT IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-119 OH YES,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-120 ARE TO BE ARRESTED FOR WILLFULLY BREAKING ONE OF THE LAWS OF OZ. BREAKING A LAW!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-121 SAID SCRAPS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-122 NONSENSE SOLDIER,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-123 YOU'RE JOKING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-124 NOT THIS TIME RETURNED THE SOLDIER WITH A SIGH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-125 MY DEAR CHILD WHAT ARE YOU A RUMMAGE SALE OR A GUESS ME QUICK?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-126 IN ME YOU BEHOLD THE BODY GUARD OF OUR GRACIOUS RULER PRINCESS OZMA AS WELL AS THE ROYAL ARMY OF OZ AND THE POLICE FORCE OF THE EMERALD CITY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-127 AND ONLY ONE MAN!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-128 EXCLAIMED THE PATCHWORK GIRL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-129 ONLY ONE AND PLENTY ENOUGH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-130 IN MY OFFICIAL POSITIONS I'VE HAD NOTHING TO DO FOR A GOOD MANY YEARS SO LONG THAT I BEGAN TO FEAR I WAS ABSOLUTELY USELESS UNTIL TO DAY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-131 AN HOUR AGO I WAS CALLED TO THE PRESENCE OF HER HIGHNESS OZMA OF OZ AND TOLD TO ARREST A BOY NAMED OJO THE UNLUCKY WHO WAS JOURNEYING FROM THE MUNCHKIN COUNTRY TO THE EMERALD CITY AND WOULD ARRIVE IN A SHORT TIME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-132 THIS COMMAND SO ASTONISHED ME THAT I NEARLY FAINTED FOR IT IS THE FIRST TIME ANYONE HAS MERITED ARREST SINCE I CAN REMEMBER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-133 YOU ARE RIGHTLY NAMED OJO THE UNLUCKY MY POOR BOY SINCE YOU HAVE BROKEN A LAW OF OZ. BUT YOU ARE WRONG SAID SCRAPS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-134 OZMA IS WRONG YOU ARE ALL WRONG FOR OJO HAS BROKEN NO LAW. THEN HE WILL SOON BE FREE AGAIN REPLIED THE SOLDIER WITH THE GREEN WHISKERS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-135 ANYONE ACCUSED OF CRIME IS GIVEN A FAIR TRIAL BY OUR RULER AND HAS EVERY CHANCE TO PROVE HIS INNOCENCE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-136 BUT JUST NOW OZMA'S ORDERS MUST BE OBEYED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-14-137 WITH THIS HE TOOK FROM HIS POCKET A PAIR OF HANDCUFFS MADE OF GOLD AND SET WITH RUBIES AND DIAMONDS AND THESE HE SNAPPED OVER OJO'S WRISTS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-01 CHAPTER FIFTEEN OZMA'S PRISONER THE BOY WAS SO BEWILDERED BY THIS CALAMITY THAT HE MADE NO RESISTANCE AT ALL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-02 HE KNEW VERY WELL HE WAS GUILTY BUT IT SURPRISED HIM THAT OZMA ALSO KNEW IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-03 HE WONDERED HOW SHE HAD FOUND OUT SO SOON THAT HE HAD PICKED THE SIX LEAVED CLOVER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-04 HE HANDED HIS BASKET TO SCRAPS AND SAID, KEEP THAT UNTIL I GET OUT OF PRISON.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-05 IF I NEVER GET OUT TAKE IT TO THE CROOKED MAGICIAN TO WHOM IT BELONGS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-06 THE SHAGGY MAN HAD BEEN GAZING EARNESTLY IN THE BOY'S FACE UNCERTAIN WHETHER TO DEFEND HIM OR NOT,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-07 BUT SOMETHING HE READ IN OJO'S EXPRESSION MADE HIM DRAW BACK AND REFUSE TO INTERFERE TO SAVE HIM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-08 THE SHAGGY MAN WAS GREATLY SURPRISED AND GRIEVED BUT HE KNEW THAT OZMA NEVER MADE MISTAKES AND SO OJO MUST REALLY HAVE BROKEN THE LAW OF OZ. THE SOLDIER WITH THE GREEN WHISKERS NOW LED THEM ALL THROUGH THE GATE AND INTO A LITTLE ROOM BUILT IN THE WALL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-09 HERE SAT A JOLLY LITTLE MAN RICHLY DRESSED IN GREEN AND HAVING AROUND HIS NECK A HEAVY GOLD CHAIN TO WHICH A NUMBER OF GREAT GOLDEN KEYS WERE ATTACHED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-10 THIS WAS THE GUARDIAN OF THE GATE AND AT THE MOMENT THEY ENTERED HIS ROOM HE WAS PLAYING A TUNE UPON A MOUTH ORGAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-11 LISTEN!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-12 HE SAID HOLDING UP HIS HAND FOR SILENCE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-13 I'VE JUST COMPOSED A TUNE CALLED THE SPECKLED ALLIGATOR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-14 IT'S IN PATCH TIME WHICH IS MUCH SUPERIOR TO RAG TIME AND I'VE COMPOSED IT IN HONOR OF THE PATCHWORK GIRL WHO HAS JUST ARRIVED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-15 HOW DID YOU KNOW I HAD ARRIVED?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-16 ASKED SCRAPS MUCH INTERESTED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-17 IT'S MY BUSINESS TO KNOW WHO'S COMING FOR I'M THE GUARDIAN OF THE GATE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-18 KEEP QUIET WHILE I PLAY YOU THE SPECKLED ALLIGATOR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-19 IT WASN'T A VERY BAD TUNE NOR A VERY GOOD ONE BUT ALL LISTENED RESPECTFULLY WHILE HE SHUT HIS EYES AND SWAYED HIS HEAD FROM SIDE TO SIDE AND BLEW THE NOTES FROM THE LITTLE INSTRUMENT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-20 WHEN IT WAS ALL OVER THE SOLDIER WITH THE GREEN WHISKERS SAID, GUARDIAN I HAVE HERE A PRISONER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-21 GOOD GRACIOUS!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-22 A PRISONER?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-23 CRIED THE LITTLE MAN JUMPING UP FROM HIS CHAIR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-24 WHICH ONE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-25 NOT THE SHAGGY MAN?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-26 NO,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-27 THIS BOY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-28 AH,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-29 I HOPE HIS FAULT IS AS SMALL AS HIMSELF SAID THE GUARDIAN OF THE GATE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-30 BUT WHAT CAN HE HAVE DONE AND WHAT MADE HIM DO IT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-31 CAN'T SAY REPLIED THE SOLDIER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-32 ALL I KNOW IS THAT HE HAS BROKEN THE LAW. BUT NO ONE EVER DOES THAT!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-33 THEN HE MUST BE INNOCENT AND SOON WILL BE RELEASED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-34 I HOPE YOU ARE RIGHT GUARDIAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-35 JUST NOW I AM ORDERED TO TAKE HIM TO PRISON.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-36 GET ME A PRISONER'S ROBE FROM YOUR OFFICIAL WARDROBE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-37 THE GUARDIAN UNLOCKED A CLOSET AND TOOK FROM IT A WHITE ROBE WHICH THE SOLDIER THREW OVER OJO. IT COVERED HIM FROM HEAD TO FOOT BUT HAD TWO HOLES JUST IN FRONT OF HIS EYES SO HE COULD SEE WHERE TO GO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-38 IN THIS ATTIRE THE BOY PRESENTED A VERY QUAINT APPEARANCE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-39 AS THE GUARDIAN UNLOCKED A GATE LEADING FROM HIS ROOM INTO THE STREETS OF THE EMERALD CITY THE SHAGGY MAN SAID TO SCRAPS, I THINK I SHALL TAKE YOU DIRECTLY TO DOROTHY AS THE SCARECROW ADVISED AND THE GLASS CAT AND THE WOOZY MAY COME WITH US.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-40 OJO MUST GO TO PRISON WITH THE SOLDIER WITH THE GREEN WHISKERS BUT HE WILL BE WELL TREATED AND YOU NEED NOT WORRY ABOUT HIM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-41 WHAT WILL THEY DO WITH HIM?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-42 ASKED SCRAPS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-43 THAT I CANNOT TELL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-44 SINCE I CAME TO THE LAND OF OZ NO ONE HAS EVER BEEN ARRESTED OR IMPRISONED UNTIL OJO BROKE THE LAW. SEEMS TO ME THAT GIRL RULER OF YOURS IS MAKING A BIG FUSS OVER NOTHING REMARKED SCRAPS TOSSING HER YARN HAIR OUT OF HER EYES WITH A JERK OF HER PATCHED HEAD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-45 I DON'T KNOW WHAT OJO HAS DONE BUT IT COULDN'T BE ANYTHING VERY BAD FOR YOU AND I WERE WITH HIM ALL THE TIME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-46 THE SHAGGY MAN MADE NO REPLY TO THIS SPEECH AND PRESENTLY THE PATCHWORK GIRL FORGOT ALL ABOUT OJO IN HER ADMIRATION OF THE WONDERFUL CITY SHE HAD ENTERED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-47 THEY SOON SEPARATED FROM THE MUNCHKIN BOY WHO WAS LED BY THE SOLDIER WITH THE GREEN WHISKERS DOWN A SIDE STREET TOWARD THE PRISON.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-48 OJO FELT VERY MISERABLE AND GREATLY ASHAMED OF HIMSELF BUT HE WAS BEGINNING TO GROW ANGRY BECAUSE HE WAS TREATED IN SUCH A DISGRACEFUL MANNER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-49 INSTEAD OF ENTERING THE SPLENDID EMERALD CITY AS A RESPECTABLE TRAVELER WHO WAS ENTITLED TO A WELCOME AND TO HOSPITALITY HE WAS BEING BROUGHT IN AS A CRIMINAL HANDCUFFED AND IN A ROBE THAT TOLD ALL HE MET OF HIS DEEP DISGRACE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-50 OJO WAS BY NATURE GENTLE AND AFFECTIONATE AND IF HE HAD DISOBEYED THE LAW OF OZ IT WAS TO RESTORE HIS DEAR UNC NUNKIE TO LIFE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-51 HIS FAULT WAS MORE THOUGHTLESS THAN WICKED BUT THAT DID NOT ALTER THE FACT THAT HE HAD COMMITTED A FAULT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-52 AT FIRST HE HAD FELT SORROW AND REMORSE BUT THE MORE HE THOUGHT ABOUT THE UNJUST TREATMENT HE HAD RECEIVED UNJUST MERELY BECAUSE HE CONSIDERED IT SO THE MORE HE RESENTED HIS ARREST BLAMING OZMA FOR MAKING FOOLISH LAWS AND THEN PUNISHING FOLKS WHO BROKE THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-53 ONLY A SIX LEAVED CLOVER!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-54 A TINY GREEN PLANT GROWING NEGLECTED AND TRAMPLED UNDER FOOT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-55 WHAT HARM COULD THERE BE IN PICKING IT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-56 OJO BEGAN TO THINK OZMA MUST BE A VERY BAD AND OPPRESSIVE RULER FOR SUCH A LOVELY FAIRYLAND AS OZ. THE SHAGGY MAN SAID THE PEOPLE LOVED HER,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-57 BUT HOW COULD THEY?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-58 THE LITTLE MUNCHKIN BOY WAS SO BUSY THINKING THESE THINGS WHICH MANY GUILTY PRISONERS HAVE THOUGHT BEFORE HIM THAT HE SCARCELY NOTICED ALL THE SPLENDOR OF THE CITY STREETS THROUGH WHICH THEY PASSED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-59 WHENEVER THEY MET ANY OF THE HAPPY SMILING PEOPLE THE BOY TURNED HIS HEAD AWAY IN SHAME ALTHOUGH NONE KNEW WHO WAS BENEATH THE ROBE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-60 BY AND BY THEY REACHED A HOUSE BUILT JUST BESIDE THE GREAT CITY WALL BUT IN A QUIET RETIRED PLACE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-61 IT WAS A PRETTY HOUSE NEATLY PAINTED AND WITH MANY WINDOWS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-62 BEFORE IT WAS A GARDEN FILLED WITH BLOOMING FLOWERS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-63 THE SOLDIER WITH THE GREEN WHISKERS LED OJO UP THE GRAVEL PATH TO THE FRONT DOOR ON WHICH HE KNOCKED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-64 A WOMAN OPENED THE DOOR AND SEEING OJO IN HIS WHITE ROBE EXCLAIMED, GOODNESS ME!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-65 A PRISONER AT LAST.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-66 BUT WHAT A SMALL ONE SOLDIER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-67 THE SIZE DOESN'T MATTER TOLLYDIGGLE MY DEAR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-68 THE FACT REMAINS THAT HE IS A PRISONER SAID THE SOLDIER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-69 AND THIS BEING THE PRISON AND YOU THE JAILER IT IS MY DUTY TO PLACE THE PRISONER IN YOUR CHARGE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-70 TRUE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-71 COME IN THEN AND I'LL GIVE YOU A RECEIPT FOR HIM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-72 THEY ENTERED THE HOUSE AND PASSED THROUGH A HALL TO A LARGE CIRCULAR ROOM WHERE THE WOMAN PULLED THE ROBE OFF FROM OJO AND LOOKED AT HIM WITH KINDLY INTEREST.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-73 THE BOY ON HIS PART WAS GAZING AROUND HIM IN AMAZEMENT FOR NEVER HAD HE DREAMED OF SUCH A MAGNIFICENT APARTMENT AS THIS IN WHICH HE STOOD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-74 THE ROOF OF THE DOME WAS OF COLORED GLASS WORKED INTO BEAUTIFUL DESIGNS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-75 THE WALLS WERE PANELED WITH PLATES OF GOLD DECORATED WITH GEMS OF GREAT SIZE AND MANY COLORS AND UPON THE TILED FLOOR WERE SOFT RUGS DELIGHTFUL TO WALK UPON.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-76 THE FURNITURE WAS FRAMED IN GOLD AND UPHOLSTERED IN SATIN BROCADE AND IT CONSISTED OF EASY CHAIRS DIVANS AND STOOLS IN GREAT VARIETY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-77 ALSO THERE WERE SEVERAL TABLES WITH MIRROR TOPS AND CABINETS FILLED WITH RARE AND CURIOUS THINGS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-78 IN ONE PLACE A CASE FILLED WITH BOOKS STOOD AGAINST THE WALL AND ELSEWHERE OJO SAW A CUPBOARD CONTAINING ALL SORTS OF GAMES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-79 MAY I STAY HERE A LITTLE WHILE BEFORE I GO TO PRISON?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-80 ASKED THE BOY PLEADINGLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-81 WHY THIS IS YOUR PRISON REPLIED TOLLYDIGGLE AND IN ME BEHOLD YOUR JAILOR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-82 TAKE OFF THOSE HANDCUFFS SOLDIER FOR IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANYONE TO ESCAPE FROM THIS HOUSE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-83 I KNOW THAT VERY WELL REPLIED THE SOLDIER AND AT ONCE UNLOCKED THE HANDCUFFS AND RELEASED THE PRISONER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-84 THE WOMAN TOUCHED A BUTTON ON THE WALL AND LIGHTED A BIG CHANDELIER THAT HUNG SUSPENDED FROM THE CEILING FOR IT WAS GROWING DARK OUTSIDE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-85 THEN SHE SEATED HERSELF AT A DESK AND ASKED, WHAT NAME?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-86 OJO THE UNLUCKY ANSWERED THE SOLDIER WITH THE GREEN WHISKERS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-87 UNLUCKY?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-88 AH THAT ACCOUNTS FOR IT SAID SHE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-89 WHAT CRIME?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-90 BREAKING A LAW OF OZ. ALL RIGHT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-91 THERE'S YOUR RECEIPT SOLDIER,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-92 AND NOW I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PRISONER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-93 I'M GLAD OF IT FOR THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE EVER HAD ANYTHING TO DO IN MY OFFICIAL CAPACITY REMARKED THE JAILER IN A PLEASED TONE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-94 IT'S THE SAME WITH ME TOLLYDIGGLE LAUGHED THE SOLDIER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-95 BUT MY TASK IS FINISHED AND I MUST GO AND REPORT TO OZMA THAT I'VE DONE MY DUTY LIKE A FAITHFUL POLICE FORCE A LOYAL ARMY AND AN HONEST BODY GUARD AS I HOPE I AM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-96 SAYING THIS HE NODDED FAREWELL TO TOLLYDIGGLE AND OJO AND WENT AWAY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-97 NOW THEN SAID THE WOMAN BRISKLY I MUST GET YOU SOME SUPPER FOR YOU ARE DOUBTLESS HUNGRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-98 WHAT WOULD YOU PREFER, PLANKED WHITEFISH OMELET WITH JELLY OR MUTTON CHOPS WITH GRAVY?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-99 OJO THOUGHT ABOUT IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-100 THEN HE SAID, I'LL TAKE THE CHOPS IF YOU PLEASE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-101 VERY WELL,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-102 AMUSE YOURSELF WHILE I'M GONE,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-103 I WON'T BE LONG AND THEN SHE WENT OUT BY A DOOR AND LEFT THE PRISONER ALONE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-104 OJO WAS MUCH ASTONISHED FOR NOT ONLY WAS THIS UNLIKE ANY PRISON HE HAD EVER HEARD OF BUT HE WAS BEING TREATED MORE AS A GUEST THAN A CRIMINAL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-105 THERE WERE MANY WINDOWS AND THEY HAD NO LOCKS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-106 THERE WERE THREE DOORS TO THE ROOM AND NONE WERE BOLTED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-107 HE CAUTIOUSLY OPENED ONE OF THE DOORS AND FOUND IT LED INTO A HALLWAY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-108 BUT HE HAD NO INTENTION OF TRYING TO ESCAPE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-109 IF HIS JAILOR WAS WILLING TO TRUST HIM IN THIS WAY HE WOULD NOT BETRAY HER TRUST AND MOREOVER A HOT SUPPER WAS BEING PREPARED FOR HIM AND HIS PRISON WAS VERY PLEASANT AND COMFORTABLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-110 SO HE TOOK A BOOK FROM THE CASE AND SAT DOWN IN A BIG CHAIR TO LOOK AT THE PICTURES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-111 THIS AMUSED HIM UNTIL THE WOMAN CAME IN WITH A LARGE TRAY AND SPREAD A CLOTH ON ONE OF THE TABLES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-112 THEN SHE ARRANGED HIS SUPPER WHICH PROVED THE MOST VARIED AND DELICIOUS MEAL OJO HAD EVER EATEN IN HIS LIFE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-113 TOLLYDIGGLE SAT NEAR HIM WHILE HE ATE SEWING ON SOME FANCY WORK SHE HELD IN HER LAP.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-114 WHEN HE HAD FINISHED SHE CLEARED THE TABLE AND THEN READ TO HIM A STORY FROM ONE OF THE BOOKS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-115 IS THIS REALLY A PRISON?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-116 HE ASKED WHEN SHE HAD FINISHED READING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-117 INDEED IT IS SHE REPLIED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-118 IT IS THE ONLY PRISON IN THE LAND OF OZ. AND AM I A PRISONER?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-119 BLESS THE CHILD!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-120 OF COURSE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-121 THEN WHY IS THE PRISON SO FINE AND WHY ARE YOU SO KIND TO ME?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-122 HE EARNESTLY ASKED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-123 TOLLYDIGGLE SEEMED SURPRISED BY THE QUESTION BUT SHE PRESENTLY ANSWERED, WE CONSIDER A PRISONER UNFORTUNATE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-124 HE IS UNFORTUNATE IN TWO WAYS BECAUSE HE HAS DONE SOMETHING WRONG AND BECAUSE HE IS DEPRIVED OF HIS LIBERTY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-125 THEREFORE WE SHOULD TREAT HIM KINDLY BECAUSE OF HIS MISFORTUNE FOR OTHERWISE HE WOULD BECOME HARD AND BITTER AND WOULD NOT BE SORRY HE HAD DONE WRONG.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-126 OZMA THINKS THAT ONE WHO HAS COMMITTED A FAULT DID SO BECAUSE HE WAS NOT STRONG AND BRAVE,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-127 THEREFORE SHE PUTS HIM IN PRISON TO MAKE HIM STRONG AND BRAVE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-128 WHEN THAT IS ACCOMPLISHED HE IS NO LONGER A PRISONER BUT A GOOD AND LOYAL CITIZEN AND EVERYONE IS GLAD THAT HE IS NOW STRONG ENOUGH TO RESIST DOING WRONG.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-129 YOU SEE IT IS KINDNESS THAT MAKES ONE STRONG AND BRAVE,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-130 AND SO WE ARE KIND TO OUR PRISONERS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-131 OJO THOUGHT THIS OVER VERY CAREFULLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-132 I HAD AN IDEA SAID HE THAT PRISONERS WERE ALWAYS TREATED HARSHLY TO PUNISH THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-133 THAT WOULD BE DREADFUL!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-134 CRIED TOLLYDIGGLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-135 ISN'T ONE PUNISHED ENOUGH IN KNOWING HE HAS DONE WRONG?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-136 DON'T YOU WISH OJO WITH ALL YOUR HEART THAT YOU HAD NOT BEEN DISOBEDIENT AND BROKEN A LAW OF OZ?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-137 I I HATE TO BE DIFFERENT FROM OTHER PEOPLE HE ADMITTED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-138 YES,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-139 ONE LIKES TO BE RESPECTED AS HIGHLY AS HIS NEIGHBORS ARE SAID THE WOMAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-140 WHEN YOU ARE TRIED AND FOUND GUILTY YOU WILL BE OBLIGED TO MAKE AMENDS IN SOME WAY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-141 I DON'T KNOW JUST WHAT OZMA WILL DO TO YOU BECAUSE THIS IS THE FIRST TIME ONE OF US HAS BROKEN A LAW,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-142 BUT YOU MAY BE SURE SHE WILL BE JUST AND MERCIFUL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-143 HERE IN THE EMERALD CITY PEOPLE ARE TOO HAPPY AND CONTENTED EVER TO DO WRONG,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-144 BUT PERHAPS YOU CAME FROM SOME FARAWAY CORNER OF OUR LAND AND HAVING NO LOVE FOR OZMA CARELESSLY BROKE ONE OF HER LAWS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-145 I THOUGHT SO SAID TOLLYDIGGLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-15-146 BUT NOW WE HAVE TALKED ENOUGH SO LET US PLAY A GAME UNTIL BEDTIME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-01 CHAPTER SIXTEEN PRINCESS DOROTHY DOROTHY GALE WAS SITTING IN ONE OF HER ROOMS IN THE ROYAL PALACE WHILE CURLED UP AT HER FEET WAS A LITTLE BLACK DOG WITH A SHAGGY COAT AND VERY BRIGHT EYES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-02 SHE WORE A PLAIN WHITE FROCK WITHOUT ANY JEWELS OR OTHER ORNAMENTS EXCEPT AN EMERALD GREEN HAIR RIBBON FOR DOROTHY WAS A SIMPLE LITTLE GIRL AND HAD NOT BEEN IN THE LEAST SPOILED BY THE MAGNIFICENCE SURROUNDING HER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-03 ONCE THE CHILD HAD LIVED ON THE KANSAS PRAIRIES BUT SHE SEEMED MARKED FOR ADVENTURE FOR SHE HAD MADE SEVERAL TRIPS TO THE LAND OF OZ BEFORE SHE CAME TO LIVE THERE FOR GOOD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-04 HER VERY BEST FRIEND WAS THE BEAUTIFUL OZMA OF OZ WHO LOVED DOROTHY SO WELL THAT SHE KEPT HER IN HER OWN PALACE SO AS TO BE NEAR HER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-05 THE GIRL'S UNCLE HENRY AND AUNT EM THE ONLY RELATIVES SHE HAD IN THE WORLD HAD ALSO BEEN BROUGHT HERE BY OZMA AND GIVEN A PLEASANT HOME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-06 DOROTHY KNEW ALMOST EVERYBODY IN OZ AND IT WAS SHE WHO HAD DISCOVERED THE SCARECROW THE TIN WOODMAN AND THE COWARDLY LION AS WELL AS TIK TOK THE CLOCKWORK MAN. HER LIFE WAS VERY PLEASANT NOW AND ALTHOUGH SHE HAD BEEN MADE A PRINCESS OF OZ BY HER FRIEND OZMA SHE DID NOT CARE MUCH TO BE A PRINCESS AND REMAINED AS SWEET AS WHEN SHE HAD BEEN PLAIN DOROTHY GALE OF KANSAS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-07 DOROTHY WAS READING IN A BOOK THIS EVENING WHEN JELLIA JAMB THE FAVORITE SERVANT MAID OF THE PALACE CAME TO SAY THAT THE SHAGGY MAN WANTED TO SEE HER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-08 ALL RIGHT SAID DOROTHY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-09 TELL HIM TO COME RIGHT UP.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-10 BUT HE HAS SOME QUEER CREATURES WITH HIM SOME OF THE QUEEREST I'VE EVER LAID EYES ON REPORTED JELLIA.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-11 NEVER MIND,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-12 LET EM ALL COME UP REPLIED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-13 BUT WHEN THE DOOR OPENED TO ADMIT NOT ONLY THE SHAGGY MAN BUT SCRAPS THE WOOZY AND THE GLASS CAT DOROTHY JUMPED UP AND LOOKED AT HER STRANGE VISITORS IN AMAZEMENT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-14 THE PATCHWORK GIRL WAS THE MOST CURIOUS OF ALL AND DOROTHY WAS UNCERTAIN AT FIRST WHETHER SCRAPS WAS REALLY ALIVE OR ONLY A DREAM OR A NIGHTMARE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-15 TOTO HER DOG SLOWLY UNCURLED HIMSELF AND GOING TO THE PATCHWORK GIRL SNIFFED AT HER INQUIRINGLY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-16 BUT SOON HE LAY DOWN AGAIN AS IF TO SAY HE HAD NO INTEREST IN SUCH AN IRREGULAR CREATION.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-17 YOU'RE A NEW ONE TO ME DOROTHY SAID REFLECTIVELY ADDRESSING THE PATCHWORK GIRL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-18 I CAN'T IMAGINE WHERE YOU'VE COME FROM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-19 WHO ME?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-20 ASKED SCRAPS LOOKING AROUND THE PRETTY ROOM INSTEAD OF AT THE GIRL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-21 OH I CAME FROM A BED QUILT I GUESS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-22 THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY ANYHOW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-23 SOME CALL IT A CRAZY QUILT AND SOME A PATCHWORK QUILT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-24 BUT MY NAME IS SCRAPS AND NOW YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT ME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-25 NOT QUITE ALL RETURNED DOROTHY WITH A SMILE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-26 I WISH YOU'D TELL ME HOW YOU CAME TO BE ALIVE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-27 THAT'S AN EASY JOB SAID SCRAPS SITTING UPON A BIG UPHOLSTERED CHAIR AND MAKING THE SPRINGS BOUNCE HER UP AND DOWN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-28 MARGOLOTTE WANTED A SLAVE SO SHE MADE ME OUT OF AN OLD BED QUILT SHE DIDN'T USE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-29 COTTON STUFFING SUSPENDER BUTTON EYES RED VELVET TONGUE PEARL BEADS FOR TEETH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-30 THE CROOKED MAGICIAN MADE A POWDER OF LIFE SPRINKLED ME WITH IT AND HERE I AM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-31 PERHAPS YOU'VE NOTICED MY DIFFERENT COLORS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-32 A VERY REFINED AND EDUCATED GENTLEMAN NAMED THE SCARECROW WHOM I MET TOLD ME I AM THE MOST BEAUTIFUL CREATURE IN ALL OZ AND I BELIEVE IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-33 OH!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-34 HAVE YOU MET OUR SCARECROW THEN?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-35 ASKED DOROTHY A LITTLE PUZZLED TO UNDERSTAND THE BRIEF HISTORY RELATED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-36 YES,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-37 ISN'T HE JOLLY?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-38 THE SCARECROW HAS MANY GOOD QUALITIES REPLIED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-39 BUT I'M SORRY TO HEAR ALL THIS BOUT THE CROOKED MAGICIAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-40 OZMA'LL BE MAD AS HOPS WHEN SHE HEARS HE'S BEEN DOING MAGIC AGAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-41 SHE TOLD HIM NOT TO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-42 HE ONLY PRACTICES MAGIC FOR THE BENEFIT OF HIS OWN FAMILY EXPLAINED BUNGLE WHO WAS KEEPING AT A RESPECTFUL DISTANCE FROM THE LITTLE BLACK DOG.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-43 DEAR ME SAID DOROTHY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-44 I HADN'T NOTICED YOU BEFORE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-45 ARE YOU GLASS OR WHAT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-46 I'M GLASS AND TRANSPARENT TOO WHICH IS MORE THAN CAN BE SAID OF SOME FOLKS ANSWERED THE CAT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-47 ALSO I HAVE SOME LOVELY PINK BRAINS,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-48 YOU CAN SEE EM WORK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-49 OH,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-50 IS THAT SO?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-51 COME OVER HERE AND LET ME SEE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-52 THE GLASS CAT HESITATED EYEING THE DOG.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-53 SEND THAT BEAST AWAY AND I WILL SHE SAID.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-54 BEAST!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-55 WHY THAT'S MY DOG TOTO AN HE'S THE KINDEST DOG IN ALL THE WORLD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-56 TOTO KNOWS A GOOD MANY THINGS TOO,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-57 AS MUCH AS I DO I GUESS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-58 WHY DOESN'T HE SAY ANYTHING?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-59 ASKED BUNGLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-60 HE CAN'T TALK NOT BEING A FAIRY DOG EXPLAINED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-61 HE'S JUST A COMMON UNITED STATES DOG,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-62 BUT THAT'S A GOOD DEAL,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-63 AND I UNDERSTAND HIM AND HE UNDERSTANDS ME JUST AS WELL AS IF HE COULD TALK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-64 TOTO AT THIS GOT UP AND RUBBED HIS HEAD SOFTLY AGAINST DOROTHY'S HAND WHICH SHE HELD OUT TO HIM AND HE LOOKED UP INTO HER FACE AS IF HE HAD UNDERSTOOD EVERY WORD SHE HAD SAID.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-65 THIS CAT TOTO SHE SAID TO HIM IS MADE OF GLASS SO YOU MUSTN'T BOTHER IT OR CHASE IT ANY MORE THAN YOU DO MY PINK KITTEN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-66 IT'S PROB'LY BRITTLE AND MIGHT BREAK IF IT BUMPED AGAINST ANYTHING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-67 WOOF!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-68 SAID TOTO AND THAT MEANT HE UNDERSTOOD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-69 THE GLASS CAT WAS SO PROUD OF HER PINK BRAINS THAT SHE VENTURED TO COME CLOSE TO DOROTHY IN ORDER THAT THE GIRL MIGHT SEE EM WORK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-70 THIS WAS REALLY INTERESTING BUT WHEN DOROTHY PATTED THE CAT SHE FOUND THE GLASS COLD AND HARD AND UNRESPONSIVE SO SHE DECIDED AT ONCE THAT BUNGLE WOULD NEVER DO FOR A PET.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-71 WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THE CROOKED MAGICIAN WHO LIVES ON THE MOUNTAIN?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-72 ASKED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-73 HE MADE ME REPLIED THE CAT,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-74 SO I KNOW ALL ABOUT HIM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-75 THE PATCHWORK GIRL IS NEW THREE OR FOUR DAYS OLD BUT I'VE LIVED WITH DOCTOR PIPT FOR YEARS,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-76 AND THOUGH I DON'T MUCH CARE FOR HIM I WILL SAY THAT HE HAS ALWAYS REFUSED TO WORK MAGIC FOR ANY OF THE PEOPLE WHO COME TO HIS HOUSE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-77 HE THINKS THERE'S NO HARM IN DOING MAGIC THINGS FOR HIS OWN FAMILY AND HE MADE ME OUT OF GLASS BECAUSE THE MEAT CATS DRINK TOO MUCH MILK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-78 HE ALSO MADE SCRAPS COME TO LIFE SO SHE COULD DO THE HOUSEWORK FOR HIS WIFE MARGOLOTTE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-79 THEN WHY DID YOU BOTH LEAVE HIM?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-80 ASKED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-81 I THINK YOU'D BETTER LET ME EXPLAIN THAT INTERRUPTED THE SHAGGY MAN AND THEN HE TOLD DOROTHY ALL OF OJO'S STORY AND HOW UNC NUNKIE AND MARGOLOTTE HAD ACCIDENTALLY BEEN TURNED TO MARBLE BY THE LIQUID OF PETRIFACTION.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-82 THEN HE RELATED HOW THE BOY HAD STARTED OUT IN SEARCH OF THE THINGS NEEDED TO MAKE THE MAGIC CHARM WHICH WOULD RESTORE THE UNFORTUNATES TO LIFE AND HOW HE HAD FOUND THE WOOZY AND TAKEN HIM ALONG BECAUSE HE COULD NOT PULL THE THREE HAIRS OUT OF ITS TAIL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-83 DOROTHY LISTENED TO ALL THIS WITH MUCH INTEREST AND THOUGHT THAT SO FAR OJO HAD ACTED VERY WELL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-84 BUT WHEN THE SHAGGY MAN TOLD HER OF THE MUNCHKIN BOY'S ARREST BY THE SOLDIER WITH THE GREEN WHISKERS BECAUSE HE WAS ACCUSED OF WILFULLY BREAKING A LAW OF OZ THE LITTLE GIRL WAS GREATLY SHOCKED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-85 WHAT DO YOU S'POSE HE'S DONE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-86 SHE ASKED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-87 I FEAR HE HAS PICKED A SIX LEAVED CLOVER ANSWERED THE SHAGGY MAN SADLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-88 I DID NOT SEE HIM DO IT AND I WARNED HIM THAT TO DO SO WAS AGAINST THE LAW,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-89 BUT PERHAPS THAT IS WHAT HE DID NEVERTHELESS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-90 I'M SORRY BOUT THAT SAID DOROTHY GRAVELY FOR NOW THERE WILL BE NO ONE TO HELP HIS POOR UNCLE AND MARGOLOTTE CEPT THIS PATCHWORK GIRL THE WOOZY AND THE GLASS CAT. DON'T MENTION IT SAID SCRAPS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-91 THAT'S NO AFFAIR OF MINE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-92 MARGOLOTTE AND UNC NUNKIE ARE PERFECT STRANGERS TO ME FOR THE MOMENT I CAME TO LIFE THEY CAME TO MARBLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-93 I SEE REMARKED DOROTHY WITH A SIGH OF REGRET,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-94 THE WOMAN FORGOT TO GIVE YOU A HEART.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-95 I'M GLAD SHE DID RETORTED THE PATCHWORK GIRL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-96 A HEART MUST BE A GREAT ANNOYANCE TO ONE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-97 IT MAKES A PERSON FEEL SAD OR SORRY OR DEVOTED OR SYMPATHETIC ALL OF WHICH SENSATIONS INTERFERE WITH ONE'S HAPPINESS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-98 I HAVE A HEART MURMURED THE GLASS CAT. IT'S MADE OF A RUBY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-99 BUT I DON'T IMAGINE I SHALL LET IT BOTHER ME ABOUT HELPING UNC NUNKIE AND MARGOLOTTE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-100 THAT'S A PRETTY HARD HEART OF YOURS SAID DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-101 AND THE WOOZY OF COURSE WHY AS FOR ME OBSERVED THE WOOZY WHO WAS RECLINING ON THE FLOOR WITH HIS LEGS DOUBLED UNDER HIM SO THAT HE LOOKED MUCH LIKE A SQUARE BOX I HAVE NEVER SEEN THOSE UNFORTUNATE PEOPLE YOU ARE SPEAKING OF AND YET I AM SORRY FOR THEM HAVING AT TIMES BEEN UNFORTUNATE MYSELF.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-102 WHEN I WAS SHUT UP IN THAT FOREST I LONGED FOR SOME ONE TO HELP ME AND BY AND BY OJO CAME AND DID HELP ME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-103 SO I'M WILLING TO HELP HIS UNCLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-104 I'M ONLY A STUPID BEAST DOROTHY BUT I CAN'T HELP THAT AND IF YOU'LL TELL ME WHAT TO DO TO HELP OJO AND HIS UNCLE I'LL GLADLY DO IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-105 DOROTHY WALKED OVER AND PATTED THE WOOZY ON HIS SQUARE HEAD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-106 YOU'RE NOT PRETTY SHE SAID BUT I LIKE YOU.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-107 WHAT ARE YOU ABLE TO DO,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-108 ANYTHING SPECIAL?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-109 I CAN MAKE MY EYES FLASH FIRE REAL FIRE WHEN I'M ANGRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-110 WHEN ANYONE SAYS, KRIZZLE KROO TO ME I GET ANGRY AND THEN MY EYES FLASH FIRE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-111 I DON'T SEE AS FIREWORKS COULD HELP OJO'S UNCLE REMARKED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-112 CAN YOU DO ANYTHING ELSE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-113 I I THOUGHT I HAD A VERY TERRIFYING GROWL SAID THE WOOZY WITH HESITATION,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-114 BUT PERHAPS I WAS MISTAKEN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-115 YES SAID THE SHAGGY MAN YOU WERE CERTAINLY WRONG ABOUT THAT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-116 THEN HE TURNED TO DOROTHY AND ADDED, WHAT WILL BECOME OF THE MUNCHKIN BOY?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-117 I DON'T KNOW SHE SAID SHAKING HER HEAD THOUGHTFULLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-118 OZMA WILL SEE HIM BOUT IT OF COURSE AND THEN SHE'LL PUNISH HIM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-119 BUT HOW I DON'T KNOW CAUSE NO ONE EVER HAS BEEN PUNISHED IN OZ SINCE I KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT THE PLACE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-120 TOO BAD SHAGGY MAN ISN'T IT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-121 WHILE THEY WERE TALKING SCRAPS HAD BEEN ROAMING AROUND THE ROOM AND LOOKING AT ALL THE PRETTY THINGS IT CONTAINED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-122 SHE HAD CARRIED OJO'S BASKET IN HER HAND UNTIL NOW WHEN SHE DECIDED TO SEE WHAT WAS INSIDE IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-123 SHE FOUND THE BREAD AND CHEESE WHICH SHE HAD NO USE FOR AND THE BUNDLE OF CHARMS WHICH WERE CURIOUS BUT QUITE A MYSTERY TO HER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-124 THEN TURNING THESE OVER SHE CAME UPON THE SIX LEAVED CLOVER WHICH THE BOY HAD PLUCKED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-125 SCRAPS WAS QUICK WITTED AND ALTHOUGH SHE HAD NO HEART SHE RECOGNIZED THE FACT THAT OJO WAS HER FIRST FRIEND.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-126 SHE KNEW AT ONCE THAT BECAUSE THE BOY HAD TAKEN THE CLOVER HE HAD BEEN IMPRISONED AND SHE UNDERSTOOD THAT OJO HAD GIVEN HER THE BASKET SO THEY WOULD NOT FIND THE CLOVER IN HIS POSSESSION AND HAVE PROOF OF HIS CRIME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-127 SO TURNING HER HEAD TO SEE THAT NO ONE NOTICED HER SHE TOOK THE CLOVER FROM THE BASKET AND DROPPED IT INTO A GOLDEN VASE THAT STOOD ON DOROTHY'S TABLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-128 THEN SHE CAME FORWARD AND SAID TO DOROTHY, I WOULDN'T CARE TO HELP OJO'S UNCLE BUT I WILL HELP OJO. HE DID NOT BREAK THE LAW NO ONE CAN PROVE HE DID AND THAT GREEN WHISKERED SOLDIER HAD NO RIGHT TO ARREST HIM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-129 OZMA ORDERED THE BOY'S ARREST SAID DOROTHY AND OF COURSE SHE KNEW WHAT SHE WAS DOING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-130 BUT IF YOU CAN PROVE OJO IS INNOCENT THEY WILL SET HIM FREE AT ONCE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-131 THEY'LL HAVE TO PROVE HIM GUILTY WON'T THEY?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-132 ASKED SCRAPS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-133 I S'POSE SO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-134 WELL THEY CAN'T DO THAT DECLARED THE PATCHWORK GIRL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-135 AS IT WAS NEARLY TIME FOR DOROTHY TO DINE WITH OZMA WHICH SHE DID EVERY EVENING SHE RANG FOR A SERVANT AND ORDERED THE WOOZY TAKEN TO A NICE ROOM AND GIVEN PLENTY OF SUCH FOOD AS HE LIKED BEST.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-136 THAT'S HONEY BEES SAID THE WOOZY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-137 YOU CAN'T EAT HONEY BEES BUT YOU'LL BE GIVEN SOMETHING JUST AS NICE DOROTHY TOLD HIM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-16-138 THEN SHE HAD THE GLASS CAT TAKEN TO ANOTHER ROOM FOR THE NIGHT AND THE PATCHWORK GIRL SHE KEPT IN ONE OF HER OWN ROOMS FOR SHE WAS MUCH INTERESTED IN THE STRANGE CREATURE AND WANTED TO TALK WITH HER AGAIN AND TRY TO UNDERSTAND HER BETTER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-17-01 CHAPTER SEVENTEEN OZMA AND HER FRIENDS THE SHAGGY MAN HAD A ROOM OF HIS OWN IN THE ROYAL PALACE SO THERE HE WENT TO CHANGE HIS SHAGGY SUIT OF CLOTHES FOR ANOTHER JUST AS SHAGGY BUT NOT SO DUSTY FROM TRAVEL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-17-02 HE SELECTED A COSTUME OF PEA GREEN AND PINK SATIN AND VELVET WITH EMBROIDERED SHAGS ON ALL THE EDGES AND IRIDESCENT PEARLS FOR ORNAMENTS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-17-03 THEN HE BATHED IN AN ALABASTER POOL AND BRUSHED HIS SHAGGY HAIR AND WHISKERS THE WRONG WAY TO MAKE THEM STILL MORE SHAGGY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-17-04 THIS ACCOMPLISHED AND ARRAYED IN HIS SPLENDID SHAGGY GARMENTS HE WENT TO OZMA'S BANQUET HALL AND FOUND THE SCARECROW THE WIZARD AND DOROTHY ALREADY ASSEMBLED THERE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-17-05 THE SCARECROW HAD MADE A QUICK TRIP AND RETURNED TO THE EMERALD CITY WITH HIS LEFT EAR FRESHLY PAINTED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-17-06 A MOMENT LATER WHILE THEY ALL STOOD IN WAITING A SERVANT THREW OPEN A DOOR THE ORCHESTRA STRUCK UP A TUNE AND OZMA OF OZ ENTERED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-17-07 MUCH HAS BEEN TOLD AND WRITTEN CONCERNING THE BEAUTY OF PERSON AND CHARACTER OF THIS SWEET GIRL RULER OF THE LAND OF OZ THE RICHEST THE HAPPIEST AND MOST DELIGHTFUL FAIRYLAND OF WHICH WE HAVE ANY KNOWLEDGE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-17-08 YET WITH ALL HER QUEENLY QUALITIES OZMA WAS A REAL GIRL AND ENJOYED THE THINGS IN LIFE THAT OTHER REAL GIRLS ENJOY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-17-09 WHEN SHE SAT ON HER SPLENDID EMERALD THRONE IN THE GREAT THRONE ROOM OF HER PALACE AND MADE LAWS AND SETTLED DISPUTES AND TRIED TO KEEP ALL HER SUBJECTS HAPPY AND CONTENTED SHE WAS AS DIGNIFIED AND DEMURE AS ANY QUEEN MIGHT BE,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-17-10 BUT WHEN SHE HAD THROWN ASIDE HER JEWELED ROBE OF STATE AND HER SCEPTRE AND HAD RETIRED TO HER PRIVATE APARTMENTS THE GIRL JOYOUS LIGHT HEARTED AND FREE REPLACED THE SEDATE RULER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-17-11 IN THE BANQUET HALL TO NIGHT WERE GATHERED ONLY OLD AND TRUSTED FRIENDS SO HERE OZMA WAS HERSELF A MERE GIRL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-17-12 SHE GREETED DOROTHY WITH A KISS THE SHAGGY MAN WITH A SMILE THE LITTLE OLD WIZARD WITH A FRIENDLY HANDSHAKE AND THEN SHE PRESSED THE SCARECROW'S STUFFED ARM AND CRIED MERRILY, WHAT A LOVELY LEFT EAR!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-17-13 WHY IT'S A HUNDRED TIMES BETTER THAN THE OLD ONE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-17-14 I'M GLAD YOU LIKE IT REPLIED THE SCARECROW WELL PLEASED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-17-15 JINJUR DID A NEAT JOB DIDN'T SHE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-17-16 AND MY HEARING IS NOW PERFECT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-17-17 ISN'T IT WONDERFUL WHAT A LITTLE PAINT WILL DO IF IT'S PROPERLY APPLIED?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-17-18 IT REALLY IS WONDERFUL SHE AGREED AS THEY ALL TOOK THEIR SEATS,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-17-19 BUT THE SAWHORSE MUST HAVE MADE HIS LEGS TWINKLE TO HAVE CARRIED YOU SO FAR IN ONE DAY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-17-20 I DIDN'T EXPECT YOU BACK BEFORE TO MORROW AT THE EARLIEST.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-17-21 WELL SAID THE SCARECROW I MET A CHARMING GIRL ON THE ROAD AND WANTED TO SEE MORE OF HER SO I HURRIED BACK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-17-22 OZMA LAUGHED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-17-23 I KNOW SHE RETURNED,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-17-24 IT'S THE PATCHWORK GIRL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-17-25 SHE IS CERTAINLY BEWILDERING IF NOT STRICTLY BEAUTIFUL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-17-26 HAVE YOU SEEN HER THEN?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-17-27 THE STRAW MAN EAGERLY ASKED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-17-28 ONLY IN MY MAGIC PICTURE WHICH SHOWS ME ALL SCENES OF INTEREST IN THE LAND OF OZ. I FEAR THE PICTURE DIDN'T DO HER JUSTICE SAID THE SCARECROW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-17-29 IT SEEMED TO ME THAT NOTHING COULD BE MORE GORGEOUS DECLARED OZMA.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-17-30 WHOEVER MADE THAT PATCHWORK QUILT FROM WHICH SCRAPS WAS FORMED MUST HAVE SELECTED THE GAYEST AND BRIGHTEST BITS OF CLOTH THAT EVER WERE WOVEN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-17-31 I AM GLAD YOU LIKE HER SAID THE SCARECROW IN A SATISFIED TONE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-17-32 ALTHOUGH THE STRAW MAN DID NOT EAT NOT BEING MADE SO HE COULD HE OFTEN DINED WITH OZMA AND HER COMPANIONS MERELY FOR THE PLEASURE OF TALKING WITH THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-17-33 HE SAT AT THE TABLE AND HAD A NAPKIN AND PLATE BUT THE SERVANTS KNEW BETTER THAN TO OFFER HIM FOOD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-17-34 AFTER A LITTLE WHILE HE ASKED, WHERE IS THE PATCHWORK GIRL NOW?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-17-35 IN MY ROOM REPLIED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-17-36 I'VE TAKEN A FANCY TO HER,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-17-37 SHE'S SO QUEER AND AND UNCOMMON.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-17-38 SHE'S HALF CRAZY I THINK ADDED THE SHAGGY MAN. BUT SHE IS SO BEAUTIFUL!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-17-39 EXCLAIMED THE SCARECROW AS IF THAT FACT DISARMED ALL CRITICISM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-17-40 THEY ALL LAUGHED AT HIS ENTHUSIASM BUT THE SCARECROW WAS QUITE SERIOUS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-17-41 SEEING THAT HE WAS INTERESTED IN SCRAPS THEY FORBORE TO SAY ANYTHING AGAINST HER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-17-42 THE LITTLE BAND OF FRIENDS OZMA HAD GATHERED AROUND HER WAS SO QUAINTLY ASSORTED THAT MUCH CARE MUST BE EXERCISED TO AVOID HURTING THEIR FEELINGS OR MAKING ANY ONE OF THEM UNHAPPY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-17-43 IT WAS THIS CONSIDERATE KINDNESS THAT HELD THEM CLOSE FRIENDS AND ENABLED THEM TO ENJOY ONE ANOTHER'S SOCIETY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-17-44 ANOTHER THING THEY AVOIDED WAS CONVERSING ON UNPLEASANT SUBJECTS AND FOR THAT REASON OJO AND HIS TROUBLES WERE NOT MENTIONED DURING THE DINNER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-17-45 THE SHAGGY MAN HOWEVER RELATED HIS ADVENTURES WITH THE MONSTROUS PLANTS WHICH HAD SEIZED AND ENFOLDED THE TRAVELERS AND TOLD HOW HE HAD ROBBED CHISS THE GIANT PORCUPINE OF THE QUILLS WHICH IT WAS ACCUSTOMED TO THROW AT PEOPLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-17-46 BOTH DOROTHY AND OZMA WERE PLEASED WITH THIS EXPLOIT AND THOUGHT IT SERVED CHISS RIGHT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-17-47 THEN THEY TALKED OF THE WOOZY WHICH WAS THE MOST REMARKABLE ANIMAL ANY OF THEM HAD EVER BEFORE SEEN EXCEPT PERHAPS THE LIVE SAWHORSE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-17-48 OZMA HAD NEVER KNOWN THAT HER DOMINIONS CONTAINED SUCH A THING AS A WOOZY THERE BEING BUT ONE IN EXISTENCE AND THIS BEING CONFINED IN HIS FOREST FOR MANY YEARS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-17-49 DOROTHY SAID SHE BELIEVED THE WOOZY WAS A GOOD BEAST HONEST AND FAITHFUL,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-17-50 BUT SHE ADDED THAT SHE DID NOT CARE MUCH FOR THE GLASS CAT. STILL SAID THE SHAGGY MAN THE GLASS CAT IS VERY PRETTY AND IF SHE WERE NOT SO CONCEITED OVER HER PINK BRAINS NO ONE WOULD OBJECT TO HER AS A COMPANION.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-17-51 THE WIZARD HAD BEEN EATING SILENTLY UNTIL NOW WHEN HE LOOKED UP AND REMARKED, THAT POWDER OF LIFE WHICH IS MADE BY THE CROOKED MAGICIAN IS REALLY A WONDERFUL THING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-17-52 BUT DOCTOR PIPT DOES NOT KNOW ITS TRUE VALUE AND HE USES IT IN THE MOST FOOLISH WAYS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-17-53 I MUST SEE ABOUT THAT SAID OZMA GRAVELY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-17-54 WELL WHEN I WAS A BABY GIRL I WAS STOLEN BY AN OLD WITCH NAMED MOMBI AND TRANSFORMED INTO A BOY BEGAN THE GIRL RULER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-17-55 I DID NOT KNOW WHO I WAS AND WHEN I GREW BIG ENOUGH TO WORK THE WITCH MADE ME WAIT UPON HER AND CARRY WOOD FOR THE FIRE AND HOE IN THE GARDEN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-17-56 ONE DAY SHE CAME BACK FROM A JOURNEY BRINGING SOME OF THE POWDER OF LIFE WHICH DOCTOR PIPT HAD GIVEN HER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-17-57 I HAD MADE A PUMPKIN HEADED MAN AND SET IT UP IN HER PATH TO FRIGHTEN HER FOR I WAS FOND OF FUN AND HATED THE WITCH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-17-58 BUT SHE KNEW WHAT THE FIGURE WAS AND TO TEST HER POWDER OF LIFE SHE SPRINKLED SOME OF IT ON THE MAN I HAD MADE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-17-59 IT CAME TO LIFE AND IS NOW OUR DEAR FRIEND JACK PUMPKINHEAD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-17-60 THAT NIGHT I RAN AWAY WITH JACK TO ESCAPE PUNISHMENT AND I TOOK OLD MOMBI'S POWDER OF LIFE WITH ME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-17-61 DURING OUR JOURNEY WE CAME UPON A WOODEN SAWHORSE STANDING BY THE ROAD AND I USED THE MAGIC POWDER TO BRING IT TO LIFE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-17-62 THE SAWHORSE HAS BEEN WITH ME EVER SINCE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-17-63 WHEN I GOT TO THE EMERALD CITY THE GOOD SORCERESS GLINDA KNEW WHO I WAS AND RESTORED ME TO MY PROPER PERSON WHEN I BECAME THE RIGHTFUL RULER OF THIS LAND.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-17-64 SO YOU SEE HAD NOT OLD MOMBI BROUGHT HOME THE POWDER OF LIFE I MIGHT NEVER HAVE RUN AWAY FROM HER AND BECOME OZMA OF OZ NOR WOULD WE HAVE HAD JACK PUMPKINHEAD AND THE SAWHORSE TO COMFORT AND AMUSE US.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-17-65 THAT STORY INTERESTED THE SHAGGY MAN VERY MUCH AS WELL AS THE OTHERS WHO HAD OFTEN HEARD IT BEFORE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-17-66 THE DINNER BEING NOW CONCLUDED THEY ALL WENT TO OZMA'S DRAWING ROOM WHERE THEY PASSED A PLEASANT EVENING BEFORE IT CAME TIME TO RETIRE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-01 CHAPTER EIGHTEEN OJO IS FORGIVEN THE NEXT MORNING THE SOLDIER WITH THE GREEN WHISKERS WENT TO THE PRISON AND TOOK OJO AWAY TO THE ROYAL PALACE WHERE HE WAS SUMMONED TO APPEAR BEFORE THE GIRL RULER FOR JUDGMENT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-02 AGAIN THE SOLDIER PUT UPON THE BOY THE JEWELED HANDCUFFS AND WHITE PRISONER'S ROBE WITH THE PEAKED TOP AND HOLES FOR THE EYES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-03 OJO WAS SO ASHAMED BOTH OF HIS DISGRACE AND THE FAULT HE HAD COMMITTED THAT HE WAS GLAD TO BE COVERED UP IN THIS WAY SO THAT PEOPLE COULD NOT SEE HIM OR KNOW WHO HE WAS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-04 HE FOLLOWED THE SOLDIER WITH THE GREEN WHISKERS VERY WILLINGLY ANXIOUS THAT HIS FATE MIGHT BE DECIDED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-05 THE INHABITANTS OF THE EMERALD CITY WERE POLITE PEOPLE AND NEVER JEERED AT THE UNFORTUNATE,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-06 BUT IT WAS SO LONG SINCE THEY HAD SEEN A PRISONER THAT THEY CAST MANY CURIOUS LOOKS TOWARD THE BOY AND MANY OF THEM HURRIED AWAY TO THE ROYAL PALACE TO BE PRESENT DURING THE TRIAL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-07 WHEN OJO WAS ESCORTED INTO THE GREAT THRONE ROOM OF THE PALACE HE FOUND HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE ASSEMBLED THERE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-08 IN THE MAGNIFICENT EMERALD THRONE WHICH SPARKLED WITH COUNTLESS JEWELS SAT OZMA OF OZ IN HER ROBE OF STATE WHICH WAS EMBROIDERED WITH EMERALDS AND PEARLS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-09 ON HER RIGHT BUT A LITTLE LOWER WAS DOROTHY AND ON HER LEFT THE SCARECROW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-10 STILL LOWER BUT NEARLY IN FRONT OF OZMA SAT THE WONDERFUL WIZARD OF OZ AND ON A SMALL TABLE BESIDE HIM WAS THE GOLDEN VASE FROM DOROTHY'S ROOM INTO WHICH SCRAPS HAD DROPPED THE STOLEN CLOVER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-11 AT OZMA'S FEET CROUCHED TWO ENORMOUS BEASTS EACH THE LARGEST AND MOST POWERFUL OF ITS KIND.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-12 ALTHOUGH THESE BEASTS WERE QUITE FREE NO ONE PRESENT WAS ALARMED BY THEM,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-13 FOR THE COWARDLY LION AND THE HUNGRY TIGER WERE WELL KNOWN AND RESPECTED IN THE EMERALD CITY AND THEY ALWAYS GUARDED THE RULER WHEN SHE HELD HIGH COURT IN THE THRONE ROOM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-14 THERE WAS STILL ANOTHER BEAST PRESENT BUT THIS ONE DOROTHY HELD IN HER ARMS FOR IT WAS HER CONSTANT COMPANION THE LITTLE DOG TOTO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-15 TOTO KNEW THE COWARDLY LION AND THE HUNGRY TIGER AND OFTEN PLAYED AND ROMPED WITH THEM FOR THEY WERE GOOD FRIENDS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-16 SEATED ON IVORY CHAIRS BEFORE OZMA WITH A CLEAR SPACE BETWEEN THEM AND THE THRONE WERE MANY OF THE NOBILITY OF THE EMERALD CITY LORDS AND LADIES IN BEAUTIFUL COSTUMES AND OFFICIALS OF THE KINGDOM IN THE ROYAL UNIFORMS OF OZ. BEHIND THESE COURTIERS WERE OTHERS OF LESS IMPORTANCE FILLING THE GREAT HALL TO THE VERY DOORS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-17 AT THE SAME MOMENT THAT THE SOLDIER WITH THE GREEN WHISKERS ARRIVED WITH OJO THE SHAGGY MAN ENTERED FROM A SIDE DOOR ESCORTING THE PATCHWORK GIRL THE WOOZY AND THE GLASS CAT. ALL THESE CAME TO THE VACANT SPACE BEFORE THE THRONE AND STOOD FACING THE RULER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-18 HULLO OJO SAID SCRAPS,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-19 HOW ARE YOU?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-20 ALL RIGHT HE REPLIED,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-21 BUT THE SCENE AWED THE BOY AND HIS VOICE TREMBLED A LITTLE WITH FEAR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-22 NOTHING COULD AWE THE PATCHWORK GIRL AND ALTHOUGH THE WOOZY WAS SOMEWHAT UNEASY IN THESE SPLENDID SURROUNDINGS THE GLASS CAT WAS DELIGHTED WITH THE SUMPTUOUSNESS OF THE COURT AND THE IMPRESSIVENESS OF THE OCCASION PRETTY BIG WORDS BUT QUITE EXPRESSIVE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-23 AT A SIGN FROM OZMA THE SOLDIER REMOVED OJO'S WHITE ROBE AND THE BOY STOOD FACE TO FACE WITH THE GIRL WHO WAS TO DECIDE HIS PUNISHMENT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-24 HE SAW AT A GLANCE HOW LOVELY AND SWEET SHE WAS AND HIS HEART GAVE A BOUND OF JOY FOR HE HOPED SHE WOULD BE MERCIFUL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-25 OZMA SAT LOOKING AT THE PRISONER A LONG TIME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-26 THEN SHE SAID GENTLY, ONE OF THE LAWS OF OZ FORBIDS ANYONE TO PICK A SIX LEAVED CLOVER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-27 YOU ARE ACCUSED OF HAVING BROKEN THIS LAW EVEN AFTER YOU HAD BEEN WARNED NOT TO DO SO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-28 OJO HUNG HIS HEAD AND WHILE HE HESITATED HOW TO REPLY THE PATCHWORK GIRL STEPPED FORWARD AND SPOKE FOR HIM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-29 ALL THIS FUSS IS ABOUT NOTHING AT ALL SHE SAID FACING OZMA UNABASHED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-30 YOU CAN'T PROVE HE PICKED THE SIX LEAVED CLOVER SO YOU'VE NO RIGHT TO ACCUSE HIM OF IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-31 SEARCH HIM IF YOU LIKE BUT YOU WON'T FIND THE CLOVER,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-32 LOOK IN HIS BASKET AND YOU'LL FIND IT'S NOT THERE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-33 HE HASN'T GOT IT SO I DEMAND THAT YOU SET THIS POOR MUNCHKIN BOY FREE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-34 THE PEOPLE OF OZ LISTENED TO THIS DEFIANCE IN AMAZEMENT AND WONDERED AT THE QUEER PATCHWORK GIRL WHO DARED TALK SO BOLDLY TO THEIR RULER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-35 BUT OZMA SAT SILENT AND MOTIONLESS AND IT WAS THE LITTLE WIZARD WHO ANSWERED SCRAPS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-36 HE SAID.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-37 I THINK IT HAS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-38 I THINK THE BOY HID IT IN HIS BASKET AND THEN GAVE THE BASKET TO YOU.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-39 I ALSO THINK YOU DROPPED THE CLOVER INTO THIS VASE WHICH STOOD IN PRINCESS DOROTHY'S ROOM HOPING TO GET RID OF IT SO IT WOULD NOT PROVE THE BOY GUILTY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-40 YOU'RE A STRANGER HERE MISS PATCHES AND SO YOU DON'T KNOW THAT NOTHING CAN BE HIDDEN FROM OUR POWERFUL RULER'S MAGIC PICTURE NOR FROM THE WATCHFUL EYES OF THE HUMBLE WIZARD OF OZ. LOOK ALL OF YOU!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-41 WITH THESE WORDS HE WAVED HIS HANDS TOWARD THE VASE ON THE TABLE WHICH SCRAPS NOW NOTICED FOR THE FIRST TIME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-42 FROM THE MOUTH OF THE VASE A PLANT SPROUTED SLOWLY GROWING BEFORE THEIR EYES UNTIL IT BECAME A BEAUTIFUL BUSH AND ON THE TOPMOST BRANCH APPEARED THE SIX LEAVED CLOVER WHICH OJO HAD UNFORTUNATELY PICKED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-43 THE PATCHWORK GIRL LOOKED AT THE CLOVER AND SAID, OH SO YOU'VE FOUND IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-44 VERY WELL,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-45 PROVE HE PICKED IT IF YOU CAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-46 OZMA TURNED TO OJO. DID YOU PICK THE SIX LEAVED CLOVER?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-47 SHE ASKED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-48 YES HE REPLIED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-49 I KNEW IT WAS AGAINST THE LAW BUT I WANTED TO SAVE UNC NUNKIE AND I WAS AFRAID IF I ASKED YOUR CONSENT TO PICK IT YOU WOULD REFUSE ME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-50 WHAT CAUSED YOU TO THINK THAT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-51 ASKED THE RULER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-52 WHY IT SEEMED TO ME A FOOLISH LAW UNJUST AND UNREASONABLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-53 EVEN NOW I CAN SEE NO HARM IN PICKING A SIX LEAVED CLOVER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-54 AND I I HAD NOT SEEN THE EMERALD CITY THEN NOR YOU AND I THOUGHT A GIRL WHO WOULD MAKE SUCH A SILLY LAW WOULD NOT BE LIKELY TO HELP ANYONE IN TROUBLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-55 OZMA REGARDED HIM MUSINGLY HER CHIN RESTING UPON HER HAND,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-56 BUT SHE WAS NOT ANGRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-57 ON THE CONTRARY SHE SMILED A LITTLE AT HER THOUGHTS AND THEN GREW SOBER AGAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-58 I SUPPOSE A GOOD MANY LAWS SEEM FOOLISH TO THOSE PEOPLE WHO DO NOT UNDERSTAND THEM SHE SAID,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-59 BUT NO LAW IS EVER MADE WITHOUT SOME PURPOSE AND THAT PURPOSE IS USUALLY TO PROTECT ALL THE PEOPLE AND GUARD THEIR WELFARE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-60 AS YOU ARE A STRANGER I WILL EXPLAIN THIS LAW WHICH TO YOU SEEMS SO FOOLISH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-61 YEARS AGO THERE WERE MANY WITCHES AND MAGICIANS IN THE LAND OF OZ AND ONE OF THE THINGS THEY OFTEN USED IN MAKING THEIR MAGIC CHARMS AND TRANSFORMATIONS WAS A SIX LEAVED CLOVER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-62 THESE WITCHES AND MAGICIANS CAUSED SO MUCH TROUBLE AMONG MY PEOPLE OFTEN USING THEIR POWERS FOR EVIL RATHER THAN GOOD THAT I DECIDED TO FORBID ANYONE TO PRACTICE MAGIC OR SORCERY EXCEPT GLINDA THE GOOD AND HER ASSISTANT THE WIZARD OF OZ BOTH OF WHOM I CAN TRUST TO USE THEIR ARTS ONLY TO BENEFIT MY PEOPLE AND TO MAKE THEM HAPPIER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-63 SINCE I ISSUED THAT LAW THE LAND OF OZ HAS BEEN FAR MORE PEACEFUL AND QUIET,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-64 BUT I LEARNED THAT SOME OF THE WITCHES AND MAGICIANS WERE STILL PRACTICING MAGIC ON THE SLY AND USING THE SIX LEAVED CLOVERS TO MAKE THEIR POTIONS AND CHARMS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-65 THEREFORE I MADE ANOTHER LAW FORBIDDING ANYONE FROM PLUCKING A SIX LEAVED CLOVER OR FROM GATHERING OTHER PLANTS AND HERBS WHICH THE WITCHES BOIL IN THEIR KETTLES TO WORK MAGIC WITH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-66 THAT HAS ALMOST PUT AN END TO WICKED SORCERY IN OUR LAND SO YOU SEE THE LAW WAS NOT A FOOLISH ONE BUT WISE AND JUST,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-67 AND IN ANY EVENT IT IS WRONG TO DISOBEY A LAW. OJO KNEW SHE WAS RIGHT AND FELT GREATLY MORTIFIED TO REALIZE HE HAD ACTED AND SPOKEN SO RIDICULOUSLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-68 BUT HE RAISED HIS HEAD AND LOOKED OZMA IN THE FACE SAYING, I AM SORRY I HAVE ACTED WRONGLY AND BROKEN YOUR LAW. I DID IT TO SAVE UNC NUNKIE AND THOUGHT I WOULD NOT BE FOUND OUT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-69 BUT I AM GUILTY OF THIS ACT AND WHATEVER PUNISHMENT YOU THINK I DESERVE I WILL SUFFER WILLINGLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-70 OZMA SMILED MORE BRIGHTLY THEN AND NODDED GRACIOUSLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-71 YOU ARE FORGIVEN SHE SAID.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-72 FOR ALTHOUGH YOU HAVE COMMITTED A SERIOUS FAULT YOU ARE NOW PENITENT AND I THINK YOU HAVE BEEN PUNISHED ENOUGH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-73 SOLDIER RELEASE OJO THE LUCKY AND I BEG YOUR PARDON,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-74 I'M OJO THE UNLUCKY SAID THE BOY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-75 AT THIS MOMENT YOU ARE LUCKY SAID SHE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-76 RELEASE HIM SOLDIER AND LET HIM GO FREE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-77 THE PEOPLE WERE GLAD TO HEAR OZMA'S DECREE AND MURMURED THEIR APPROVAL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-78 AS THE ROYAL AUDIENCE WAS NOW OVER THEY BEGAN TO LEAVE THE THRONE ROOM AND SOON THERE WERE NONE REMAINING EXCEPT OJO AND HIS FRIENDS AND OZMA AND HER FAVORITES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-79 THE GIRL RULER NOW ASKED OJO TO SIT DOWN AND TELL HER ALL HIS STORY WHICH HE DID BEGINNING AT THE TIME HE HAD LEFT HIS HOME IN THE FOREST AND ENDING WITH HIS ARRIVAL AT THE EMERALD CITY AND HIS ARREST.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-80 OZMA LISTENED ATTENTIVELY AND WAS THOUGHTFUL FOR SOME MOMENTS AFTER THE BOY HAD FINISHED SPEAKING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-81 THEN SHE SAID, THE CROOKED MAGICIAN WAS WRONG TO MAKE THE GLASS CAT AND THE PATCHWORK GIRL FOR IT WAS AGAINST THE LAW. AND IF HE HAD NOT UNLAWFULLY KEPT THE BOTTLE OF LIQUID OF PETRIFACTION STANDING ON HIS SHELF THE ACCIDENT TO HIS WIFE MARGOLOTTE AND TO UNC NUNKIE COULD NOT HAVE OCCURRED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-82 I CAN UNDERSTAND HOWEVER THAT OJO WHO LOVES HIS UNCLE WILL BE UNHAPPY UNLESS HE CAN SAVE HIM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-83 ALSO I FEEL IT IS WRONG TO LEAVE THOSE TWO VICTIMS STANDING AS MARBLE STATUES WHEN THEY OUGHT TO BE ALIVE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-84 SO I PROPOSE WE ALLOW DOCTOR PIPT TO MAKE THE MAGIC CHARM WHICH WILL SAVE THEM AND THAT WE ASSIST OJO TO FIND THE THINGS HE IS SEEKING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-85 WHAT DO YOU THINK WIZARD?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-86 THAT IS PERHAPS THE BEST THING TO DO REPLIED THE WIZARD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-87 BUT AFTER THE CROOKED MAGICIAN HAS RESTORED THOSE POOR PEOPLE TO LIFE YOU MUST TAKE AWAY HIS MAGIC POWERS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-88 I WILL PROMISED OZMA.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-89 NOW TELL ME PLEASE WHAT MAGIC THINGS MUST YOU FIND?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-90 CONTINUED THE WIZARD ADDRESSING OJO. THE THREE HAIRS FROM THE WOOZY'S TAIL I HAVE SAID THE BOY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-91 THAT IS I HAVE THE WOOZY AND THE HAIRS ARE IN HIS TAIL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-92 THE SIX LEAVED CLOVER I I YOU MAY TAKE IT AND KEEP IT SAID OZMA.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-93 THAT WILL NOT BE BREAKING THE LAW FOR IT IS ALREADY PICKED AND THE CRIME OF PICKING IT IS FORGIVEN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-94 THANK YOU!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-95 CRIED OJO GRATEFULLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-96 THEN HE CONTINUED, THE NEXT THING I MUST FIND IS A GILL OF WATER FROM A DARK WELL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-97 THE WIZARD SHOOK HIS HEAD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-98 THAT SAID HE WILL BE A HARD TASK BUT IF YOU TRAVEL FAR ENOUGH YOU MAY DISCOVER IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-99 I AM WILLING TO TRAVEL FOR YEARS IF IT WILL SAVE UNC NUNKIE DECLARED OJO EARNESTLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-100 THEN YOU'D BETTER BEGIN YOUR JOURNEY AT ONCE ADVISED THE WIZARD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-101 DOROTHY HAD BEEN LISTENING WITH INTEREST TO THIS CONVERSATION.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-102 NOW SHE TURNED TO OZMA AND ASKED, MAY I GO WITH OJO TO HELP HIM?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-103 WOULD YOU LIKE TO?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-104 RETURNED OZMA.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-105 YES. I KNOW OZ PRETTY WELL BUT OJO DOESN'T KNOW IT AT ALL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-106 I'M SORRY FOR HIS UNCLE AND POOR MARGOLOTTE AND I'D LIKE TO HELP SAVE THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-107 MAY I GO?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-108 IF YOU WISH TO REPLIED OZMA.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-109 IF DOROTHY GOES THEN I MUST GO TO TAKE CARE OF HER SAID THE SCARECROW DECIDEDLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-110 A DARK WELL CAN ONLY BE DISCOVERED IN SOME OUT OF THE WAY PLACE AND THERE MAY BE DANGERS THERE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-111 YOU HAVE MY PERMISSION TO ACCOMPANY DOROTHY SAID OZMA.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-112 AND WHILE YOU ARE GONE I WILL TAKE CARE OF THE PATCHWORK GIRL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-113 I'LL TAKE CARE OF MYSELF ANNOUNCED SCRAPS FOR I'M GOING WITH THE SCARECROW AND DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-114 I PROMISED OJO TO HELP HIM FIND THE THINGS HE WANTS AND I'LL STICK TO MY PROMISE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-115 VERY WELL REPLIED OZMA.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-116 BUT I SEE NO NEED FOR OJO TO TAKE THE GLASS CAT AND THE WOOZY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-117 I PREFER TO REMAIN HERE SAID THE CAT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-118 I'VE NEARLY BEEN NICKED HALF A DOZEN TIMES ALREADY AND IF THEY'RE GOING INTO DANGERS IT'S BEST FOR ME TO KEEP AWAY FROM THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-119 LET JELLIA JAMB KEEP HER TILL OJO RETURNS SUGGESTED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-120 WE WON'T NEED TO TAKE THE WOOZY EITHER BUT HE OUGHT TO BE SAVED BECAUSE OF THE THREE HAIRS IN HIS TAIL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-121 BETTER TAKE ME ALONG SAID THE WOOZY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-122 MY EYES CAN FLASH FIRE YOU KNOW AND I CAN GROWL A LITTLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-123 I'M SURE YOU'LL BE SAFER HERE OZMA DECIDED AND THE WOOZY MADE NO FURTHER OBJECTION TO THE PLAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-124 AFTER CONSULTING TOGETHER THEY DECIDED THAT OJO AND HIS PARTY SHOULD LEAVE THE VERY NEXT DAY TO SEARCH FOR THE GILL OF WATER FROM A DARK WELL SO THEY NOW SEPARATED TO MAKE PREPARATIONS FOR THE JOURNEY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-125 OZMA GAVE THE MUNCHKIN BOY A ROOM IN THE PALACE FOR THAT NIGHT AND THE AFTERNOON HE PASSED WITH DOROTHY GETTING ACQUAINTED AS SHE SAID AND RECEIVING ADVICE FROM THE SHAGGY MAN AS TO WHERE THEY MUST GO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-126 THE SHAGGY MAN HAD WANDERED IN MANY PARTS OF OZ AND SO HAD DOROTHY FOR THAT MATTER YET NEITHER OF THEM KNEW WHERE A DARK WELL WAS TO BE FOUND.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-127 IF SUCH A THING IS ANYWHERE IN THE SETTLED PARTS OF OZ SAID DOROTHY WE'D PROB'LY HAVE HEARD OF IT LONG AGO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-128 IF IT'S IN THE WILD PARTS OF THE COUNTRY NO ONE THERE WOULD NEED A DARK WELL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-129 P'RAPS THERE ISN'T SUCH A THING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-130 OH THERE MUST BE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-131 RETURNED OJO POSITIVELY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-132 OR ELSE THE RECIPE OF DOCTOR PIPT WOULDN'T CALL FOR IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-133 THAT'S TRUE AGREED DOROTHY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-134 AND IF IT'S ANYWHERE IN THE LAND OF OZ WE'RE BOUND TO FIND IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-135 WELL WE'RE BOUND TO SEARCH FOR IT ANYHOW SAID THE SCARECROW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-136 AS FOR FINDING IT WE MUST TRUST TO LUCK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-18-137 I'M CALLED OJO THE UNLUCKY YOU KNOW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-01 CHAPTER NINETEEN TROUBLE WITH THE TOTTENHOTS A DAY'S JOURNEY FROM THE EMERALD CITY BROUGHT THE LITTLE BAND OF ADVENTURERS TO THE HOME OF JACK PUMPKINHEAD WHICH WAS A HOUSE FORMED FROM THE SHELL OF AN IMMENSE PUMPKIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-02 JACK HAD MADE IT HIMSELF AND WAS VERY PROUD OF IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-03 THERE WAS A DOOR AND SEVERAL WINDOWS AND THROUGH THE TOP WAS STUCK A STOVEPIPE THAT LED FROM A SMALL STOVE INSIDE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-04 THE DOOR WAS REACHED BY A FLIGHT OF THREE STEPS AND THERE WAS A GOOD FLOOR ON WHICH WAS ARRANGED SOME FURNITURE THAT WAS QUITE COMFORTABLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-05 IT IS CERTAIN THAT JACK PUMPKINHEAD MIGHT HAVE HAD A MUCH FINER HOUSE TO LIVE IN HAD HE WANTED IT FOR OZMA LOVED THE STUPID FELLOW WHO HAD BEEN HER EARLIEST COMPANION,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-06 BUT JACK PREFERRED HIS PUMPKIN HOUSE AS IT MATCHED HIMSELF VERY WELL AND IN THIS HE WAS NOT SO STUPID AFTER ALL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-07 THE BODY OF THIS REMARKABLE PERSON WAS MADE OF WOOD BRANCHES OF TREES OF VARIOUS SIZES HAVING BEEN USED FOR THE PURPOSE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-08 THIS WOODEN FRAMEWORK WAS COVERED BY A RED SHIRT WITH WHITE SPOTS IN IT BLUE TROUSERS A YELLOW VEST A JACKET OF GREEN AND GOLD AND STOUT LEATHER SHOES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-09 THE NECK WAS A SHARPENED STICK ON WHICH THE PUMPKIN HEAD WAS SET AND THE EYES EARS NOSE AND MOUTH WERE CARVED ON THE SKIN OF THE PUMPKIN VERY LIKE A CHILD'S JACK O LANTERN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-10 THE HOUSE OF THIS INTERESTING CREATION STOOD IN THE CENTER OF A VAST PUMPKIN FIELD WHERE THE VINES GREW IN PROFUSION AND BORE PUMPKINS OF EXTRAORDINARY SIZE AS WELL AS THOSE WHICH WERE SMALLER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-11 SOME OF THE PUMPKINS NOW RIPENING ON THE VINES WERE ALMOST AS LARGE AS JACK'S HOUSE AND HE TOLD DOROTHY HE INTENDED TO ADD ANOTHER PUMPKIN TO HIS MANSION.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-12 THE TRAVELERS WERE CORDIALLY WELCOMED TO THIS QUAINT DOMICILE AND INVITED TO PASS THE NIGHT THERE WHICH THEY HAD PLANNED TO DO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-13 THE PATCHWORK GIRL WAS GREATLY INTERESTED IN JACK AND EXAMINED HIM ADMIRINGLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-14 YOU ARE QUITE HANDSOME SHE SAID,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-15 BUT NOT AS REALLY BEAUTIFUL AS THE SCARECROW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-16 JACK TURNED AT THIS TO EXAMINE THE SCARECROW CRITICALLY AND HIS OLD FRIEND SLYLY WINKED ONE PAINTED EYE AT HIM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-17 THERE IS NO ACCOUNTING FOR TASTES REMARKED THE PUMPKINHEAD WITH A SIGH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-18 AN OLD CROW ONCE TOLD ME I WAS VERY FASCINATING BUT OF COURSE THE BIRD MIGHT HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-19 YET I HAVE NOTICED THAT THE CROWS USUALLY AVOID THE SCARECROW WHO IS A VERY HONEST FELLOW IN HIS WAY BUT STUFFED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-20 I AM NOT STUFFED YOU WILL OBSERVE,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-21 MY BODY IS GOOD SOLID HICKORY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-22 I ADORE STUFFING SAID THE PATCHWORK GIRL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-23 WELL AS FOR THAT MY HEAD IS STUFFED WITH PUMPKIN SEEDS DECLARED JACK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-24 I USE THEM FOR BRAINS AND WHEN THEY ARE FRESH I AM INTELLECTUAL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-25 JUST NOW I REGRET TO SAY MY SEEDS ARE RATTLING A BIT SO I MUST SOON GET ANOTHER HEAD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-26 OH,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-27 DO YOU CHANGE YOUR HEAD?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-28 ASKED OJO. TO BE SURE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-29 PUMPKINS ARE NOT PERMANENT MORE'S THE PITY AND IN TIME THEY SPOIL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-30 THAT IS WHY I GROW SUCH A GREAT FIELD OF PUMPKINS THAT I MAY SELECT A NEW HEAD WHENEVER NECESSARY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-31 WHO CARVES THE FACES ON THEM?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-32 INQUIRED THE BOY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-33 I DO THAT MYSELF.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-34 I LIFT OFF MY OLD HEAD PLACE IT ON A TABLE BEFORE ME AND USE THE FACE FOR A PATTERN TO GO BY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-35 SOMETIMES THE FACES I CARVE ARE BETTER THAN OTHERS MORE EXPRESSIVE AND CHEERFUL YOU KNOW BUT I THINK THEY AVERAGE VERY WELL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-36 BEFORE SHE HAD STARTED ON THE JOURNEY DOROTHY HAD PACKED A KNAPSACK WITH THE THINGS SHE MIGHT NEED AND THIS KNAPSACK THE SCARECROW CARRIED STRAPPED TO HIS BACK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-37 THE LITTLE GIRL WORE A PLAIN GINGHAM DRESS AND A CHECKED SUNBONNET AS SHE KNEW THEY WERE BEST FITTED FOR TRAVEL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-38 OJO ALSO HAD BROUGHT ALONG HIS BASKET TO WHICH OZMA HAD ADDED A BOTTLE OF SQUARE MEAL TABLETS AND SOME FRUIT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-39 BUT JACK PUMPKINHEAD GREW A LOT OF THINGS IN HIS GARDEN BESIDES PUMPKINS SO HE COOKED FOR THEM A FINE VEGETABLE SOUP AND GAVE DOROTHY OJO AND TOTO THE ONLY ONES WHO FOUND IT NECESSARY TO EAT A PUMPKIN PIE AND SOME GREEN CHEESE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-40 FOR BEDS THEY MUST USE THE SWEET DRIED GRASSES WHICH JACK HAD STREWN ALONG ONE SIDE OF THE ROOM BUT THAT SATISFIED DOROTHY AND OJO VERY WELL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-41 TOTO OF COURSE SLEPT BESIDE HIS LITTLE MISTRESS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-42 THE SCARECROW SCRAPS AND THE PUMPKINHEAD WERE TIRELESS AND HAD NO NEED TO SLEEP SO THEY SAT UP AND TALKED TOGETHER ALL NIGHT,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-43 BUT THEY STAYED OUTSIDE THE HOUSE UNDER THE BRIGHT STARS AND TALKED IN LOW TONES SO AS NOT TO DISTURB THE SLEEPERS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-44 DURING THE CONVERSATION THE SCARECROW EXPLAINED THEIR QUEST FOR A DARK WELL AND ASKED JACK'S ADVICE WHERE TO FIND IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-45 THE PUMPKINHEAD CONSIDERED THE MATTER GRAVELY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-46 THAT IS GOING TO BE A DIFFICULT TASK SAID HE AND IF I WERE YOU I'D TAKE ANY ORDINARY WELL AND ENCLOSE IT SO AS TO MAKE IT DARK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-47 I FEAR THAT WOULDN'T DO REPLIED THE SCARECROW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-48 THE WELL MUST BE NATURALLY DARK AND THE WATER MUST NEVER HAVE SEEN THE LIGHT OF DAY FOR OTHERWISE THE MAGIC CHARM MIGHT NOT WORK AT ALL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-49 HOW MUCH OF THE WATER DO YOU NEED?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-50 ASKED JACK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-51 A GILL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-52 HOW MUCH IS A GILL?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-53 WHY A GILL IS A GILL OF COURSE ANSWERED THE SCARECROW WHO DID NOT WISH TO DISPLAY HIS IGNORANCE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-54 I KNOW!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-55 CRIED SCRAPS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-56 JACK AND JILL WENT UP THE HILL TO FETCH NO NO,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-57 THAT'S WRONG INTERRUPTED THE SCARECROW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-58 THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF GILLS I THINK,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-59 ONE IS A GIRL AND THE OTHER IS A GILLYFLOWER SAID JACK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-60 NO,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-61 A MEASURE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-62 HOW BIG A MEASURE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-63 WELL I'LL ASK DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-64 SO NEXT MORNING THEY ASKED DOROTHY AND SHE SAID, I DON'T JUST KNOW HOW MUCH A GILL IS BUT I'VE BROUGHT ALONG A GOLD FLASK THAT HOLDS A PINT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-65 THAT'S MORE THAN A GILL I'M SURE AND THE CROOKED MAGICIAN MAY MEASURE IT TO SUIT HIMSELF.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-66 BUT THE THING THAT'S BOTHERING US MOST JACK IS TO FIND THE WELL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-67 JACK GAZED AROUND THE LANDSCAPE FOR HE WAS STANDING IN THE DOORWAY OF HIS HOUSE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-68 THIS IS A FLAT COUNTRY SO YOU WON'T FIND ANY DARK WELLS HERE SAID HE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-69 YOU MUST GO INTO THE MOUNTAINS WHERE ROCKS AND CAVERNS ARE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-70 AND WHERE IS THAT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-71 ASKED OJO. IN THE QUADLING COUNTRY WHICH LIES SOUTH OF HERE REPLIED THE SCARECROW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-72 I'VE KNOWN ALL ALONG THAT WE MUST GO TO THE MOUNTAINS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-73 SO HAVE I SAID DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-74 BUT GOODNESS ME!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-75 THE QUADLING COUNTRY IS FULL OF DANGERS DECLARED JACK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-76 I'VE NEVER BEEN THERE MYSELF BUT I HAVE SAID THE SCARECROW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-77 I'VE FACED THE DREADFUL HAMMERHEADS WHICH HAVE NO ARMS AND BUTT YOU LIKE A GOAT,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-78 AND I'VE FACED THE FIGHTING TREES WHICH BEND DOWN THEIR BRANCHES TO POUND AND WHIP YOU AND HAD MANY OTHER ADVENTURES THERE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-79 IT'S A WILD COUNTRY REMARKED DOROTHY SOBERLY AND IF WE GO THERE WE'RE SURE TO HAVE TROUBLES OF OUR OWN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-80 BUT I GUESS WE'LL HAVE TO GO IF WE WANT THAT GILL OF WATER FROM THE DARK WELL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-81 SO THEY SAID GOOD BYE TO THE PUMPKINHEAD AND RESUMED THEIR TRAVELS HEADING NOW DIRECTLY TOWARD THE SOUTH COUNTRY WHERE MOUNTAINS AND ROCKS AND CAVERNS AND FORESTS OF GREAT TREES ABOUNDED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-82 THIS PART OF THE LAND OF OZ WHILE IT BELONGED TO OZMA AND OWED HER ALLEGIANCE WAS SO WILD AND SECLUDED THAT MANY QUEER PEOPLES HID IN ITS JUNGLES AND LIVED IN THEIR OWN WAY WITHOUT EVEN A KNOWLEDGE THAT THEY HAD A RULER IN THE EMERALD CITY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-83 IF THEY WERE LEFT ALONE THESE CREATURES NEVER TROUBLED THE INHABITANTS OF THE REST OF OZ BUT THOSE WHO INVADED THEIR DOMAINS ENCOUNTERED MANY DANGERS FROM THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-84 IT WAS A TWO DAYS JOURNEY FROM JACK PUMKINHEAD'S HOUSE TO THE EDGE OF THE QUADLING COUNTRY FOR NEITHER DOROTHY NOR OJO COULD WALK VERY FAST AND THEY OFTEN STOPPED BY THE WAYSIDE TO REST.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-85 THE FIRST NIGHT THEY SLEPT ON THE BROAD FIELDS AMONG THE BUTTERCUPS AND DAISIES AND THE SCARECROW COVERED THE CHILDREN WITH A GAUZE BLANKET TAKEN FROM HIS KNAPSACK SO THEY WOULD NOT BE CHILLED BY THE NIGHT AIR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-86 TOWARD EVENING OF THE SECOND DAY THEY REACHED A SANDY PLAIN WHERE WALKING WAS DIFFICULT,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-87 BUT SOME DISTANCE BEFORE THEM THEY SAW A GROUP OF PALM TREES WITH MANY CURIOUS BLACK DOTS UNDER THEM,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-88 SO THEY TRUDGED BRAVELY ON TO REACH THAT PLACE BY DARK AND SPEND THE NIGHT UNDER THE SHELTER OF THE TREES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-89 THE BLACK DOTS GREW LARGER AS THEY ADVANCED AND ALTHOUGH THE LIGHT WAS DIM DOROTHY THOUGHT THEY LOOKED LIKE BIG KETTLES TURNED UPSIDE DOWN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-90 JUST BEYOND THIS PLACE A JUMBLE OF HUGE JAGGED ROCKS LAY SCATTERED RISING TO THE MOUNTAINS BEHIND THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-91 OUR TRAVELERS PREFERRED TO ATTEMPT TO CLIMB THESE ROCKS BY DAYLIGHT AND THEY REALIZED THAT FOR A TIME THIS WOULD BE THEIR LAST NIGHT ON THE PLAINS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-92 TWILIGHT HAD FALLEN BY THE TIME THEY CAME TO THE TREES BENEATH WHICH WERE THE BLACK CIRCULAR OBJECTS THEY HAD MARKED FROM A DISTANCE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-93 DOZENS OF THEM WERE SCATTERED AROUND AND DOROTHY BENT NEAR TO ONE WHICH WAS ABOUT AS TALL AS SHE WAS TO EXAMINE IT MORE CLOSELY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-94 AS SHE DID SO THE TOP FLEW OPEN AND OUT POPPED A DUSKY CREATURE RISING ITS LENGTH INTO THE AIR AND THEN PLUMPING DOWN UPON THE GROUND JUST BESIDE THE LITTLE GIRL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-95 ANOTHER AND ANOTHER POPPED OUT OF THE CIRCULAR POT LIKE DWELLING WHILE FROM ALL THE OTHER BLACK OBJECTS CAME POPPING MORE CREATURES VERY LIKE JUMPING JACKS WHEN THEIR BOXES ARE UNHOOKED UNTIL FULLY A HUNDRED STOOD GATHERED AROUND OUR LITTLE GROUP OF TRAVELERS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-96 BY THIS TIME DOROTHY HAD DISCOVERED THEY WERE PEOPLE TINY AND CURIOUSLY FORMED BUT STILL PEOPLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-97 THEIR SKINS WERE DUSKY AND THEIR HAIR STOOD STRAIGHT UP LIKE WIRES AND WAS BRILLIANT SCARLET IN COLOR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-98 THEIR BODIES WERE BARE EXCEPT FOR SKINS FASTENED AROUND THEIR WAISTS AND THEY WORE BRACELETS ON THEIR ANKLES AND WRISTS AND NECKLACES AND GREAT PENDANT EARRINGS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-99 TOTO CROUCHED BESIDE HIS MISTRESS AND WAILED AS IF HE DID NOT LIKE THESE STRANGE CREATURES A BIT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-100 SCRAPS BEGAN TO MUTTER SOMETHING ABOUT HOPPITY POPPITY JUMPITY DUMP!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-101 BUT NO ONE PAID ANY ATTENTION TO HER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-102 OJO KEPT CLOSE TO THE SCARECROW AND THE SCARECROW KEPT CLOSE TO DOROTHY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-103 BUT THE LITTLE GIRL TURNED TO THE QUEER CREATURES AND ASKED, WHO ARE YOU?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-104 THEY ANSWERED THIS QUESTION ALL TOGETHER IN A SORT OF CHANTING CHORUS THE WORDS BEING AS FOLLOWS, WE'RE THE JOLLY TOTTENHOTS,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-105 WE DO NOT LIKE THE DAY BUT IN THE NIGHT TIS OUR DELIGHT TO GAMBOL SKIP AND PLAY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-106 WE HATE THE SUN AND FROM IT RUN THE MOON IS COOL AND CLEAR SO ON THIS SPOT EACH TOTTENHOT WAITS FOR IT TO APPEAR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-107 WE'RE EV'RY ONE CHOCK FULL OF FUN AND FULL OF MISCHIEF TOO,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-108 BUT IF YOU'RE GAY AND WITH US PLAY WE'LL DO NO HARM TO YOU.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-109 GLAD TO MEET YOU TOTTENHOTS SAID THE SCARECROW SOLEMNLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-110 BUT YOU MUSTN'T EXPECT US TO PLAY WITH YOU ALL NIGHT FOR WE'VE TRAVELED ALL DAY AND SOME OF US ARE TIRED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-111 AND WE NEVER GAMBLE ADDED THE PATCHWORK GIRL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-112 IT'S AGAINST THE LAW. THESE REMARKS WERE GREETED WITH SHOUTS OF LAUGHTER BY THE IMPISH CREATURES AND ONE SEIZED THE SCARECROW'S ARM AND WAS ASTONISHED TO FIND THE STRAW MAN WHIRL AROUND SO EASILY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-113 SO THE TOTTENHOT RAISED THE SCARECROW HIGH IN THE AIR AND TOSSED HIM OVER THE HEADS OF THE CROWD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-114 SOME ONE CAUGHT HIM AND TOSSED HIM BACK AND SO WITH SHOUTS OF GLEE THEY CONTINUED THROWING THE SCARECROW HERE AND THERE AS IF HE HAD BEEN A BASKET BALL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-115 PRESENTLY ANOTHER IMP SEIZED SCRAPS AND BEGAN TO THROW HER ABOUT IN THE SAME WAY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-116 THEY FOUND HER A LITTLE HEAVIER THAN THE SCARECROW BUT STILL LIGHT ENOUGH TO BE TOSSED LIKE A SOFA CUSHION AND THEY WERE ENJOYING THE SPORT IMMENSELY WHEN DOROTHY ANGRY AND INDIGNANT AT THE TREATMENT HER FRIENDS WERE RECEIVING RUSHED AMONG THE TOTTENHOTS AND BEGAN SLAPPING AND PUSHING THEM UNTIL SHE HAD RESCUED THE SCARECROW AND THE PATCHWORK GIRL AND HELD THEM CLOSE ON EITHER SIDE OF HER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-117 PERHAPS SHE WOULD NOT HAVE ACCOMPLISHED THIS VICTORY SO EASILY HAD NOT TOTO HELPED HER BARKING AND SNAPPING AT THE BARE LEGS OF THE IMPS UNTIL THEY WERE GLAD TO FLEE FROM HIS ATTACK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-118 AS FOR OJO SOME OF THE CREATURES HAD ATTEMPTED TO TOSS HIM ALSO BUT FINDING HIS BODY TOO HEAVY THEY THREW HIM TO THE GROUND AND A ROW OF THE IMPS SAT ON HIM AND HELD HIM FROM ASSISTING DOROTHY IN HER BATTLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-119 THE LITTLE BROWN FOLKS WERE MUCH SURPRISED AT BEING ATTACKED BY THE GIRL AND THE DOG AND ONE OR TWO WHO HAD BEEN SLAPPED HARDEST BEGAN TO CRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-120 THEN SUDDENLY THEY GAVE A SHOUT ALL TOGETHER AND DISAPPEARED IN A FLASH INTO THEIR VARIOUS HOUSES THE TOPS OF WHICH CLOSED WITH A SERIES OF POPS THAT SOUNDED LIKE A BUNCH OF FIRECRACKERS BEING EXPLODED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-121 THE ADVENTURERS NOW FOUND THEMSELVES ALONE AND DOROTHY ASKED ANXIOUSLY, IS ANYBODY HURT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-122 NOT ME ANSWERED THE SCARECROW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-123 THEY HAVE GIVEN MY STRAW A GOOD SHAKING UP AND TAKEN ALL THE LUMPS OUT OF IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-124 I AM NOW IN SPLENDID CONDITION AND AM REALLY OBLIGED TO THE TOTTENHOTS FOR THEIR KIND TREATMENT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-125 I FEEL MUCH THE SAME WAY SAID SCRAPS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-126 MY COTTON STUFFING HAD SAGGED A GOOD DEAL WITH THE DAY'S WALKING AND THEY'VE LOOSENED IT UP UNTIL I FEEL AS PLUMP AS A SAUSAGE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-127 BUT THE PLAY WAS A LITTLE ROUGH AND I'D HAD QUITE ENOUGH OF IT WHEN YOU INTERFERED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-128 SIX OF THEM SAT ON ME SAID OJO BUT AS THEY ARE SO LITTLE THEY DIDN'T HURT ME MUCH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-129 JUST THEN THE ROOF OF THE HOUSE IN FRONT OF THEM OPENED AND A TOTTENHOT STUCK HIS HEAD OUT VERY CAUTIOUSLY AND LOOKED AT THE STRANGERS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-130 CAN'T YOU TAKE A JOKE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-131 HE ASKED REPROACHFULLY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-132 HAVEN'T YOU ANY FUN IN YOU AT ALL?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-133 IF I HAD SUCH A QUALITY REPLIED THE SCARECROW YOUR PEOPLE WOULD HAVE KNOCKED IT OUT OF ME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-134 BUT I DON'T BEAR GRUDGES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-135 I FORGIVE YOU.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-136 SO DO I ADDED SCRAPS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-137 THAT IS IF YOU BEHAVE YOURSELVES AFTER THIS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-138 IT WAS JUST A LITTLE ROUGH HOUSE THAT'S ALL SAID THE TOTTENHOT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-139 BUT THE QUESTION IS NOT IF WE WILL BEHAVE BUT IF YOU WILL BEHAVE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-140 WE CAN'T BE SHUT UP HERE ALL NIGHT BECAUSE THIS IS OUR TIME TO PLAY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-141 NOR DO WE CARE TO COME OUT AND BE CHEWED UP BY A SAVAGE BEAST OR SLAPPED BY AN ANGRY GIRL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-142 THAT SLAPPING HURTS LIKE SIXTY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-143 SOME OF MY FOLKS ARE CRYING ABOUT IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-144 SO HERE'S THE PROPOSITION, YOU LET US ALONE AND WE'LL LET YOU ALONE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-145 YOU BEGAN IT DECLARED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-146 WELL YOU ENDED IT SO WE WON'T ARGUE THE MATTER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-147 MAY WE COME OUT AGAIN?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-148 OR ARE YOU STILL CRUEL AND SLAPPY?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-149 TELL YOU WHAT WE'LL DO SAID DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-150 WE'RE ALL TIRED AND WANT TO SLEEP UNTIL MORNING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-151 IF YOU'LL LET US GET INTO YOUR HOUSE AND STAY THERE UNTIL DAYLIGHT YOU CAN PLAY OUTSIDE ALL YOU WANT TO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-152 THAT'S A BARGAIN!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-153 CRIED THE TOTTENHOT EAGERLY AND HE GAVE A QUEER WHISTLE THAT BROUGHT HIS PEOPLE POPPING OUT OF THEIR HOUSES ON ALL SIDES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-154 WHEN THE HOUSE BEFORE THEM WAS VACANT DOROTHY AND OJO LEANED OVER THE HOLE AND LOOKED IN BUT COULD SEE NOTHING BECAUSE IT WAS SO DARK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-155 BUT IF THE TOTTENHOTS SLEPT THERE ALL DAY THE CHILDREN THOUGHT THEY COULD SLEEP THERE AT NIGHT SO OJO LOWERED HIMSELF DOWN AND FOUND IT WAS NOT VERY DEEP.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-156 THERE'S A SOFT CUSHION ALL OVER SAID HE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-157 COME ON IN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-158 DOROTHY HANDED TOTO TO THE BOY AND THEN CLIMBED IN HERSELF.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-159 AFTER HER CAME SCRAPS AND THE SCARECROW WHO DID NOT WISH TO SLEEP BUT PREFERRED TO KEEP OUT OF THE WAY OF THE MISCHIEVOUS TOTTENHOTS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-160 THERE SEEMED NO FURNITURE IN THE ROUND DEN BUT SOFT CUSHIONS WERE STREWN ABOUT THE FLOOR AND THESE THEY FOUND MADE VERY COMFORTABLE BEDS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-161 THEY DID NOT CLOSE THE HOLE IN THE ROOF BUT LEFT IT OPEN TO ADMIT AIR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-162 IT ALSO ADMITTED THE SHOUTS AND CEASELESS LAUGHTER OF THE IMPISH TOTTENHOTS AS THEY PLAYED OUTSIDE BUT DOROTHY AND OJO BEING WEARY FROM THEIR JOURNEY WERE SOON FAST ASLEEP.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-163 TOTO KEPT AN EYE OPEN HOWEVER AND UTTERED LOW THREATENING GROWLS WHENEVER THE RACKET MADE BY THE CREATURES OUTSIDE BECAME TOO BOISTEROUS,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-164 AND THE SCARECROW AND THE PATCHWORK GIRL SAT LEANING AGAINST THE WALL AND TALKED IN WHISPERS ALL NIGHT LONG.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-19-165 NO ONE DISTURBED THE TRAVELERS UNTIL DAYLIGHT WHEN IN POPPED THE TOTTENHOT WHO OWNED THE PLACE AND INVITED THEM TO VACATE HIS PREMISES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-01 CHAPTER TWENTY THE CAPTIVE YOOP AS THEY WERE PREPARING TO LEAVE DOROTHY ASKED, CAN YOU TELL US WHERE THERE IS A DARK WELL?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-02 NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A THING SAID THE TOTTENHOT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-03 WE LIVE OUR LIVES IN THE DARK MOSTLY AND SLEEP IN THE DAYTIME,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-04 BUT WE'VE NEVER SEEN A DARK WELL OR ANYTHING LIKE ONE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-05 DOES ANYONE LIVE ON THOSE MOUNTAINS BEYOND HERE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-06 ASKED THE SCARECROW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-07 LOTS OF PEOPLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-08 BUT YOU'D BETTER NOT VISIT THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-09 WE NEVER GO THERE WAS THE REPLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-10 WHAT ARE THE PEOPLE LIKE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-11 DOROTHY INQUIRED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-12 CAN'T SAY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-13 WE'VE BEEN TOLD TO KEEP AWAY FROM THE MOUNTAIN PATHS AND SO WE OBEY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-14 THIS SANDY DESERT IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR US AND WE'RE NOT DISTURBED HERE DECLARED THE TOTTENHOT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-15 SO THEY LEFT THE MAN SNUGGLING DOWN TO SLEEP IN HIS DUSKY DWELLING AND WENT OUT INTO THE SUNSHINE TAKING THE PATH THAT LED TOWARD THE ROCKY PLACES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-16 THEY SOON FOUND IT HARD CLIMBING FOR THE ROCKS WERE UNEVEN AND FULL OF SHARP POINTS AND EDGES AND NOW THERE WAS NO PATH AT ALL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-17 CLAMBERING HERE AND THERE AMONG THE BOULDERS THEY KEPT STEADILY ON GRADUALLY RISING HIGHER AND HIGHER UNTIL FINALLY THEY CAME TO A GREAT RIFT IN A PART OF THE MOUNTAIN WHERE THE ROCK SEEMED TO HAVE SPLIT IN TWO AND LEFT HIGH WALLS ON EITHER SIDE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-18 S'POSE WE GO THIS WAY SUGGESTED DOROTHY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-19 IT'S MUCH EASIER WALKING THAN TO CLIMB OVER THE HILLS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-20 HOW ABOUT THAT SIGN?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-21 ASKED OJO. WHAT SIGN?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-22 SHE INQUIRED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-23 THE MUNCHKIN BOY POINTED TO SOME WORDS PAINTED ON THE WALL OF ROCK BESIDE THEM WHICH DOROTHY HAD NOT NOTICED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-24 THE WORDS READ, LOOK OUT FOR YOOP.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-25 THE GIRL EYED THIS SIGN A MOMENT AND TURNED TO THE SCARECROW ASKING, WHO IS YOOP,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-26 OR WHAT IS YOOP?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-27 THE STRAW MAN SHOOK HIS HEAD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-28 THEN LOOKED AT TOTO AND THE DOG SAID WOOF!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-29 ONLY WAY TO FIND OUT IS TO GO ON SAID SCRAPS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-30 THIS BEING QUITE TRUE THEY WENT ON.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-31 AS THEY PROCEEDED THE WALLS OF ROCK ON EITHER SIDE GREW HIGHER AND HIGHER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-32 PRESENTLY THEY CAME UPON ANOTHER SIGN WHICH READ, BEWARE THE CAPTIVE YOOP.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-33 WHY AS FOR THAT REMARKED DOROTHY IF YOOP IS A CAPTIVE THERE'S NO NEED TO BEWARE OF HIM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-34 WHATEVER YOOP HAPPENS TO BE I'D MUCH RATHER HAVE HIM A CAPTIVE THAN RUNNING AROUND LOOSE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-35 SO HAD I AGREED THE SCARECROW WITH A NOD OF HIS PAINTED HEAD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-36 STILL SAID SCRAPS REFLECTIVELY, YOOP TE HOOP TE LOOP TE GOOP!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-37 WHO PUT NOODLES IN THE SOUP?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-38 WE MAY BEWARE BUT WE DON'T CARE AND DARE GO WHERE WE SCARE THE YOOP.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-39 DEAR ME!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-40 AREN'T YOU FEELING A LITTLE QUEER JUST NOW?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-41 DOROTHY ASKED THE PATCHWORK GIRL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-42 NOT QUEER BUT CRAZY SAID OJO. WHEN SHE SAYS THOSE THINGS I'M SURE HER BRAINS GET MIXED SOMEHOW AND WORK THE WRONG WAY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-43 I DON'T SEE WHY WE ARE TOLD TO BEWARE THE YOOP UNLESS HE IS DANGEROUS OBSERVED THE SCARECROW IN A PUZZLED TONE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-44 NEVER MIND,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-45 WE'LL FIND OUT ALL ABOUT HIM WHEN WE GET TO WHERE HE IS REPLIED THE LITTLE GIRL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-46 THE NARROW CANYON TURNED AND TWISTED THIS WAY AND THAT AND THE RIFT WAS SO SMALL THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO TOUCH BOTH WALLS AT THE SAME TIME BY STRETCHING OUT THEIR ARMS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-47 TOTO HAD RUN ON AHEAD FRISKING PLAYFULLY WHEN SUDDENLY HE UTTERED A SHARP BARK OF FEAR AND CAME RUNNING BACK TO THEM WITH HIS TAIL BETWEEN HIS LEGS AS DOGS DO WHEN THEY ARE FRIGHTENED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-48 AH SAID THE SCARECROW WHO WAS LEADING THE WAY WE MUST BE NEAR YOOP.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-49 JUST THEN AS HE ROUNDED A SHARP TURN THE STRAW MAN STOPPED SO SUDDENLY THAT ALL THE OTHERS BUMPED AGAINST HIM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-50 WHAT IS IT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-51 ASKED DOROTHY STANDING ON TIP TOES TO LOOK OVER HIS SHOULDER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-52 BUT THEN SHE SAW WHAT IT WAS AND CRIED OH!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-53 IN A TONE OF ASTONISHMENT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-54 IN ONE OF THE ROCK WALLS THAT AT THEIR LEFT WAS HOLLOWED A GREAT CAVERN IN FRONT OF WHICH WAS A ROW OF THICK IRON BARS THE TOPS AND BOTTOMS BEING FIRMLY FIXED IN THE SOLID ROCK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-55 OVER THIS CAVERN WAS A BIG SIGN WHICH DOROTHY READ WITH MUCH CURIOSITY SPEAKING THE WORDS ALOUD THAT ALL MIGHT KNOW WHAT THEY SAID, MISTER YOOP HIS CAVE THE LARGEST UNTAMED GIANT IN CAPTIVITY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-56 HEIGHT TWENTY ONE FEET.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-57 AND YET HE HAS BUT TWO FEET.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-58 WEIGHT SIXTEEN FORTY POUNDS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-59 BUT HE WAITS ALL THE TIME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-60 AGE FOUR HUNDRED YEARS AND UP AS THEY SAY IN THE DEPARTMENT STORE ADVERTISEMENTS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-61 TEMPER FIERCE AND FEROCIOUS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-62 EXCEPT WHEN ASLEEP.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-63 APPETITE RAVENOUS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-64 PREFERS MEAT PEOPLE AND ORANGE MARMALADE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-65 STRANGERS APPROACHING THIS CAVE DO SO AT THEIR OWN PERIL!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-66 PS DON'T FEED THE GIANT YOURSELF.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-67 VERY WELL SAID OJO WITH A SIGH,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-68 LET'S GO BACK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-69 IT'S A LONG WAY BACK DECLARED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-70 SO IT IS REMARKED THE SCARECROW AND IT MEANS A TEDIOUS CLIMB OVER THOSE SHARP ROCKS IF WE CAN'T USE THIS PASSAGE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-71 I THINK IT WILL BE BEST TO RUN BY THE GIANT'S CAVE AS FAST AS WE CAN GO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-72 MISTER YOOP SEEMS TO BE ASLEEP JUST NOW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-73 BUT THE GIANT WASN'T ASLEEP.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-74 HE SUDDENLY APPEARED AT THE FRONT OF HIS CAVERN SEIZED THE IRON BARS IN HIS GREAT HAIRY HANDS AND SHOOK THEM UNTIL THEY RATTLED IN THEIR SOCKETS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-75 YOOP WAS SO TALL THAT OUR FRIENDS HAD TO TIP THEIR HEADS WAY BACK TO LOOK INTO HIS FACE AND THEY NOTICED HE WAS DRESSED ALL IN PINK VELVET WITH SILVER BUTTONS AND BRAID.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-76 THE GIANT'S BOOTS WERE OF PINK LEATHER AND HAD TASSELS ON THEM AND HIS HAT WAS DECORATED WITH AN ENORMOUS PINK OSTRICH FEATHER CAREFULLY CURLED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-77 YO HO!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-78 HE SAID IN A DEEP BASS VOICE,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-79 I SMELL DINNER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-80 I THINK YOU ARE MISTAKEN REPLIED THE SCARECROW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-81 THERE IS NO ORANGE MARMALADE AROUND HERE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-82 AH BUT I EAT OTHER THINGS ASSERTED MISTER YOOP.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-83 THAT IS I EAT THEM WHEN I CAN GET THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-84 BUT THIS IS A LONELY PLACE AND NO GOOD MEAT HAS PASSED BY MY CAVE FOR MANY YEARS,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-85 SO I'M HUNGRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-86 HAVEN'T YOU EATEN ANYTHING IN MANY YEARS?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-87 ASKED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-88 NOTHING EXCEPT SIX ANTS AND A MONKEY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-89 I THOUGHT THE MONKEY WOULD TASTE LIKE MEAT PEOPLE BUT THE FLAVOR WAS DIFFERENT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-90 I HOPE YOU WILL TASTE BETTER FOR YOU SEEM PLUMP AND TENDER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-91 OH I'M NOT GOING TO BE EATEN SAID DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-92 WHY NOT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-93 I SHALL KEEP OUT OF YOUR WAY SHE ANSWERED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-94 HOW HEARTLESS!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-95 WAILED THE GIANT SHAKING THE BARS AGAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-96 CONSIDER HOW MANY YEARS IT IS SINCE I'VE EATEN A SINGLE PLUMP LITTLE GIRL!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-97 THEY TELL ME MEAT IS GOING UP BUT IF I CAN MANAGE TO CATCH YOU I'M SURE IT WILL SOON BE GOING DOWN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-98 AND I'LL CATCH YOU IF I CAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-99 WITH THIS THE GIANT PUSHED HIS BIG ARMS WHICH LOOKED LIKE TREE TRUNKS EXCEPT THAT TREE TRUNKS DON'T WEAR PINK VELVET BETWEEN THE IRON BARS AND THE ARMS WERE SO LONG THAT THEY TOUCHED THE OPPOSITE WALL OF THE ROCK PASSAGE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-100 THEN HE EXTENDED THEM AS FAR AS HE COULD REACH TOWARD OUR TRAVELERS AND FOUND HE COULD ALMOST TOUCH THE SCARECROW BUT NOT QUITE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-101 COME A LITTLE NEARER PLEASE BEGGED THE GIANT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-102 I'M A SCARECROW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-103 A SCARECROW?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-104 UGH!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-105 I DON'T CARE A STRAW FOR A SCARECROW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-106 WHO IS THAT BRIGHT COLORED DELICACY BEHIND YOU?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-107 ME?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-108 ASKED SCRAPS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-109 I'M A PATCHWORK GIRL AND I'M STUFFED WITH COTTON.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-110 DEAR ME SIGHED THE GIANT IN A DISAPPOINTED TONE,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-111 THAT REDUCES MY DINNER FROM FOUR TO TWO AND THE DOG.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-112 I'LL SAVE THE DOG FOR DESSERT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-113 TOTO GROWLED KEEPING A GOOD DISTANCE AWAY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-114 BACK UP SAID THE SCARECROW TO THOSE BEHIND HIM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-115 LET US GO BACK A LITTLE WAY AND TALK THIS OVER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-116 SO THEY TURNED AND WENT AROUND THE BEND IN THE PASSAGE WHERE THEY WERE OUT OF SIGHT OF THE CAVE AND MISTER YOOP COULD NOT HEAR THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-117 MY IDEA BEGAN THE SCARECROW WHEN THEY HAD HALTED IS TO MAKE A DASH PAST THE CAVE GOING ON A RUN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-118 HE'D GRAB US SAID DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-119 WELL HE CAN'T GRAB BUT ONE AT A TIME AND I'LL GO FIRST.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-120 AS SOON AS HE GRABS ME THE REST OF YOU CAN SLIP PAST HIM OUT OF HIS REACH AND HE WILL SOON LET ME GO BECAUSE I AM NOT FIT TO EAT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-121 THEY DECIDED TO TRY THIS PLAN AND DOROTHY TOOK TOTO IN HER ARMS SO AS TO PROTECT HIM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-122 SHE FOLLOWED JUST AFTER THE SCARECROW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-123 THEN CAME OJO WITH SCRAPS THE LAST OF THE FOUR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-124 THEIR HEARTS BEAT A LITTLE FASTER THAN USUAL AS THEY AGAIN APPROACHED THE GIANT'S CAVE THIS TIME MOVING SWIFTLY FORWARD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-125 IT TURNED OUT ABOUT THE WAY THE SCARECROW HAD PLANNED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-126 MISTER YOOP WAS QUITE ASTONISHED TO SEE THEM COME FLYING TOWARD HIM AND THRUSTING HIS ARMS BETWEEN THE BARS HE SEIZED THE SCARECROW IN A FIRM GRIP.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-127 IN THE NEXT INSTANT HE REALIZED FROM THE WAY THE STRAW CRUNCHED BETWEEN HIS FINGERS THAT HE HAD CAPTURED THE NON EATABLE MAN BUT DURING THAT INSTANT OF DELAY DOROTHY AND OJO HAD SLIPPED BY THE GIANT AND WERE OUT OF REACH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-128 UTTERING A HOWL OF RAGE THE MONSTER THREW THE SCARECROW AFTER THEM WITH ONE HAND AND GRABBED SCRAPS WITH THE OTHER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-129 THE POOR SCARECROW WENT WHIRLING THROUGH THE AIR AND SO CLEVERLY WAS HE AIMED THAT HE STRUCK OJO'S BACK AND SENT THE BOY TUMBLING HEAD OVER HEELS AND HE TRIPPED DOROTHY AND SENT HER ALSO SPRAWLING UPON THE GROUND.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-130 TOTO FLEW OUT OF THE LITTLE GIRL'S ARMS AND LANDED SOME DISTANCE AHEAD AND ALL WERE SO DAZED THAT IT WAS A MOMENT BEFORE THEY COULD SCRAMBLE TO THEIR FEET AGAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-131 WHEN THEY DID SO THEY TURNED TO LOOK TOWARD THE GIANT'S CAVE AND AT THAT MOMENT THE FEROCIOUS MISTER YOOP THREW THE PATCHWORK GIRL AT THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-132 DOWN WENT ALL THREE AGAIN IN A HEAP WITH SCRAPS ON TOP.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-133 THE GIANT ROARED SO TERRIBLY THAT FOR A TIME THEY WERE AFRAID HE HAD BROKEN LOOSE,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-134 BUT HE HADN'T.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-135 SO THEY SAT IN THE ROAD AND LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER IN A RATHER BEWILDERED WAY AND THEN BEGAN TO FEEL GLAD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-136 WE DID IT!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-137 EXCLAIMED THE SCARECROW WITH SATISFACTION.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-138 AND NOW WE ARE FREE TO GO ON OUR WAY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-139 MISTER YOOP IS VERY IMPOLITE DECLARED SCRAPS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-140 HE JARRED ME TERRIBLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-141 IT'S LUCKY MY STITCHES ARE SO FINE AND STRONG FOR OTHERWISE SUCH HARSH TREATMENT MIGHT RIP ME UP THE BACK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-142 ALLOW ME TO APOLOGIZE FOR THE GIANT SAID THE SCARECROW RAISING THE PATCHWORK GIRL TO HER FEET AND DUSTING HER SKIRT WITH HIS STUFFED HANDS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-143 MISTER YOOP IS A PERFECT STRANGER TO ME BUT I FEAR FROM THE RUDE MANNER IN WHICH HE HAS ACTED THAT HE IS NO GENTLEMAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-144 DOROTHY AND OJO LAUGHED AT THIS STATEMENT AND TOTO BARKED AS IF HE UNDERSTOOD THE JOKE AFTER WHICH THEY ALL FELT BETTER AND RESUMED THE JOURNEY IN HIGH SPIRITS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-145 OF COURSE SAID THE LITTLE GIRL WHEN THEY HAD WALKED A WAY ALONG THE PASSAGE IT WAS LUCKY FOR US THE GIANT WAS CAGED,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-20-146 FOR IF HE HAD HAPPENED TO BE LOOSE HE HE PERHAPS IN THAT CASE HE WOULDN'T BE HUNGRY ANY MORE SAID OJO GRAVELY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-01 CHAPTER TWENTY ONE HIP HOPPER THE CHAMPION THEY MUST HAVE HAD GOOD COURAGE TO CLIMB ALL THOSE ROCKS FOR AFTER GETTING OUT OF THE CANYON THEY ENCOUNTERED MORE ROCK HILLS TO BE SURMOUNTED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-02 TOTO COULD JUMP FROM ONE ROCK TO ANOTHER QUITE EASILY BUT THE OTHERS HAD TO CREEP AND CLIMB WITH CARE SO THAT AFTER A WHOLE DAY OF SUCH WORK DOROTHY AND OJO FOUND THEMSELVES VERY TIRED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-03 AS THEY GAZED UPWARD AT THE GREAT MASS OF TUMBLED ROCKS THAT COVERED THE STEEP INCLINE DOROTHY GAVE A LITTLE GROAN AND SAID, THAT'S GOING TO BE A TER'BLE HARD CLIMB SCARECROW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-04 I WISH WE COULD FIND THE DARK WELL WITHOUT SO MUCH TROUBLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-05 SUPPOSE SAID OJO YOU WAIT HERE AND LET ME DO THE CLIMBING FOR IT'S ON MY ACCOUNT WE'RE SEARCHING FOR THE DARK WELL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-06 THEN IF I DON'T FIND ANYTHING I'LL COME BACK AND JOIN YOU.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-07 NO REPLIED THE LITTLE GIRL SHAKING HER HEAD POSITIVELY WE'LL ALL GO TOGETHER FOR THAT WAY WE CAN HELP EACH OTHER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-08 IF YOU WENT ALONE SOMETHING MIGHT HAPPEN TO YOU OJO. SO THEY BEGAN THE CLIMB AND FOUND IT INDEED DIFFICULT FOR A WAY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-09 BUT PRESENTLY IN CREEPING OVER THE BIG CRAGS THEY FOUND A PATH AT THEIR FEET WHICH WOUND IN AND OUT AMONG THE MASSES OF ROCK AND WAS QUITE SMOOTH AND EASY TO WALK UPON.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-10 AS THE PATH GRADUALLY ASCENDED THE MOUNTAIN ALTHOUGH IN A ROUNDABOUT WAY THEY DECIDED TO FOLLOW IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-11 THIS MUST BE THE ROAD TO THE COUNTRY OF THE HOPPERS SAID THE SCARECROW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-12 WHO ARE THE HOPPERS?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-13 ASKED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-14 SOME PEOPLE JACK PUMPKINHEAD TOLD ME ABOUT HE REPLIED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-15 I DIDN'T HEAR HIM REPLIED THE GIRL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-16 NO,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-17 YOU WERE ASLEEP EXPLAINED THE SCARECROW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-18 BUT HE TOLD SCRAPS AND ME THAT THE HOPPERS AND THE HORNERS LIVE ON THIS MOUNTAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-19 HE SAID IN THE MOUNTAIN DECLARED SCRAPS,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-20 BUT OF COURSE HE MEANT ON IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-21 DIDN'T HE SAY WHAT THE HOPPERS AND HORNERS WERE LIKE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-22 INQUIRED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-23 NO,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-24 HE ONLY SAID THEY WERE TWO SEPARATE NATIONS AND THAT THE HORNERS WERE THE MOST IMPORTANT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-25 WELL IF WE GO TO THEIR COUNTRY WE'LL FIND OUT ALL ABOUT EM SAID THE GIRL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-26 BUT I'VE NEVER HEARD OZMA MENTION THOSE PEOPLE SO THEY CAN'T BE VERY IMPORTANT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-27 IS THIS MOUNTAIN IN THE LAND OF OZ?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-28 ASKED SCRAPS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-29 COURSE IT IS ANSWERED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-30 IT'S IN THE SOUTH COUNTRY OF THE QUADLINGS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-31 WHEN ONE COMES TO THE EDGE OF OZ IN ANY DIRECTION THERE IS NOTHING MORE TO BE SEEN AT ALL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-32 ONCE YOU COULD SEE SANDY DESERT ALL AROUND OZ,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-33 BUT NOW IT'S DIFF'RENT AND NO OTHER PEOPLE CAN SEE US ANY MORE THAN WE CAN SEE THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-34 IF THE MOUNTAIN IS UNDER OZMA'S RULE WHY DOESN'T SHE KNOW ABOUT THE HOPPERS AND THE HORNERS?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-35 OJO ASKED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-36 WHY IT'S A FAIRYLAND EXPLAINED DOROTHY AND LOTS OF QUEER PEOPLE LIVE IN PLACES SO TUCKED AWAY THAT THOSE IN THE EMERALD CITY NEVER EVEN HEAR OF EM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-37 IN THE MIDDLE OF THE COUNTRY IT'S DIFF'RENT BUT WHEN YOU GET AROUND THE EDGES YOU'RE SURE TO RUN INTO STRANGE LITTLE CORNERS THAT SURPRISE YOU.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-38 I KNOW FOR I'VE TRAVELED IN OZ A GOOD DEAL AND SO HAS THE SCARECROW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-39 YES ADMITTED THE STRAW MAN I'VE BEEN CONSIDERABLE OF A TRAVELER IN MY TIME AND I LIKE TO EXPLORE STRANGE PLACES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-40 I FIND I LEARN MUCH MORE BY TRAVELING THAN BY STAYING AT HOME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-41 DURING THIS CONVERSATION THEY HAD BEEN WALKING UP THE STEEP PATHWAY AND NOW FOUND THEMSELVES WELL UP ON THE MOUNTAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-42 THEY COULD SEE NOTHING AROUND THEM FOR THE ROCKS BESIDE THEIR PATH WERE HIGHER THAN THEIR HEADS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-43 NOR COULD THEY SEE FAR IN FRONT OF THEM BECAUSE THE PATH WAS SO CROOKED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-44 BUT SUDDENLY THEY STOPPED BECAUSE THE PATH ENDED AND THERE WAS NO PLACE TO GO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-45 AHEAD WAS A BIG ROCK LYING AGAINST THE SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN AND THIS BLOCKED THE WAY COMPLETELY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-46 THERE WOULDN'T BE A PATH THOUGH IF IT DIDN'T GO SOMEWHERE SAID THE SCARECROW WRINKLING HIS FOREHEAD IN DEEP THOUGHT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-47 THIS IS SOMEWHERE ISN'T IT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-48 ASKED THE PATCHWORK GIRL LAUGHING AT THE BEWILDERED LOOKS OF THE OTHERS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-49 THE PATH IS LOCKED THE WAY IS BLOCKED YET HERE WE'VE INNOCENTLY FLOCKED,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-50 AND NOW WE'RE HERE IT'S RATHER QUEER THERE'S NO FRONT DOOR THAT CAN BE KNOCKED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-51 PLEASE DON'T SCRAPS SAID OJO. YOU MAKE ME NERVOUS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-52 WELL SAID DOROTHY I'M GLAD OF A LITTLE REST FOR THAT'S A DREA'FUL STEEP PATH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-53 AS SHE SPOKE SHE LEANED AGAINST THE EDGE OF THE BIG ROCK THAT STOOD IN THEIR WAY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-54 TO HER SURPRISE IT SLOWLY SWUNG BACKWARD AND SHOWED BEHIND IT A DARK HOLE THAT LOOKED LIKE THE MOUTH OF A TUNNEL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-55 WHY HERE'S WHERE THE PATH GOES TO!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-56 SHE EXCLAIMED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-57 SO IT IS ANSWERED THE SCARECROW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-58 BUT THE QUESTION IS DO WE WANT TO GO WHERE THE PATH DOES?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-59 IT'S UNDERGROUND,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-60 RIGHT INSIDE THE MOUNTAIN SAID OJO PEERING INTO THE DARK HOLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-61 PERHAPS THERE'S A WELL THERE,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-62 AND IF THERE IS IT'S SURE TO BE A DARK ONE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-63 WHY THAT'S TRUE ENOUGH!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-64 CRIED DOROTHY WITH EAGERNESS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-65 LET'S GO IN SCARECROW,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-66 CAUSE IF OTHERS HAVE GONE WE'RE PRETTY SAFE TO GO TOO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-67 TOTO LOOKED IN AND BARKED BUT HE DID NOT VENTURE TO ENTER UNTIL THE SCARECROW HAD BRAVELY GONE FIRST.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-68 SCRAPS FOLLOWED CLOSELY AFTER THE STRAW MAN AND THEN OJO AND DOROTHY TIMIDLY STEPPED INSIDE THE TUNNEL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-69 AS SOON AS ALL OF THEM HAD PASSED THE BIG ROCK IT SLOWLY TURNED AND FILLED UP THE OPENING AGAIN,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-70 BUT NOW THEY WERE NO LONGER IN THE DARK FOR A SOFT ROSY LIGHT ENABLED THEM TO SEE AROUND THEM QUITE DISTINCTLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-71 IT WAS ONLY A PASSAGE WIDE ENOUGH FOR TWO OF THEM TO WALK ABREAST WITH TOTO IN BETWEEN THEM AND IT HAD A HIGH ARCHED ROOF.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-72 THEY COULD NOT SEE WHERE THE LIGHT WHICH FLOODED THE PLACE SO PLEASANTLY CAME FROM FOR THERE WERE NO LAMPS ANYWHERE VISIBLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-73 THE PASSAGE RAN STRAIGHT FOR A LITTLE WAY AND THEN MADE A BEND TO THE RIGHT AND ANOTHER SHARP TURN TO THE LEFT AFTER WHICH IT WENT STRAIGHT AGAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-74 BUT THERE WERE NO SIDE PASSAGES SO THEY COULD NOT LOSE THEIR WAY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-75 AFTER PROCEEDING SOME DISTANCE TOTO WHO HAD GONE ON AHEAD BEGAN TO BARK LOUDLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-76 THEY RAN AROUND A BEND TO SEE WHAT WAS THE MATTER AND FOUND A MAN SITTING ON THE FLOOR OF THE PASSAGE AND LEANING HIS BACK AGAINST THE WALL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-77 HE HAD PROBABLY BEEN ASLEEP BEFORE TOTO'S BARKS AROUSED HIM FOR HE WAS NOW RUBBING HIS EYES AND STARING AT THE LITTLE DOG WITH ALL HIS MIGHT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-78 THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT THIS MAN THAT TOTO OBJECTED TO AND WHEN HE SLOWLY ROSE TO HIS FOOT THEY SAW WHAT IT WAS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-79 HE HAD BUT ONE LEG SET JUST BELOW THE MIDDLE OF HIS ROUND FAT BODY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-80 BUT IT WAS A STOUT LEG AND HAD A BROAD FLAT FOOT AT THE BOTTOM OF IT ON WHICH THE MAN SEEMED TO STAND VERY WELL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-81 HE HAD NEVER HAD BUT THIS ONE LEG WHICH LOOKED SOMETHING LIKE A PEDESTAL AND WHEN TOTO RAN UP AND MADE A GRAB AT THE MAN'S ANKLE HE HOPPED FIRST ONE WAY AND THEN ANOTHER IN A VERY ACTIVE MANNER LOOKING SO FRIGHTENED THAT SCRAPS LAUGHED ALOUD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-82 TOTO WAS USUALLY A WELL BEHAVED DOG BUT THIS TIME HE WAS ANGRY AND SNAPPED AT THE MAN'S LEG AGAIN AND AGAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-83 THIS FILLED THE POOR FELLOW WITH FEAR AND IN HOPPING OUT OF TOTO'S REACH HE SUDDENLY LOST HIS BALANCE AND TUMBLED HEEL OVER HEAD UPON THE FLOOR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-84 WHEN HE SAT UP HE KICKED TOTO ON THE NOSE AND MADE THE DOG HOWL ANGRILY BUT DOROTHY NOW RAN FORWARD AND CAUGHT TOTO'S COLLAR HOLDING HIM BACK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-85 DO YOU SURRENDER?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-86 SHE ASKED THE MAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-87 WHO?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-88 ME?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-89 ASKED THE HOPPER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-90 YES,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-91 YOU SAID THE LITTLE GIRL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-92 AM I CAPTURED?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-93 HE INQUIRED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-94 OF COURSE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-95 MY DOG HAS CAPTURED YOU SHE SAID.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-96 WELL REPLIED THE MAN IF I'M CAPTURED I MUST SURRENDER FOR IT'S THE PROPER THING TO DO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-97 I LIKE TO DO EVERYTHING PROPER FOR IT SAVES ONE A LOT OF TROUBLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-98 IT DOES INDEED SAID DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-99 PLEASE TELL US WHO YOU ARE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-100 I'M HIP HOPPER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-101 HIP HOPPER THE CHAMPION.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-102 CHAMPION WHAT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-103 SHE ASKED IN SURPRISE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-104 CHAMPION WRESTLER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-105 I'M A VERY STRONG MAN AND THAT FEROCIOUS ANIMAL WHICH YOU ARE SO KINDLY HOLDING IS THE FIRST LIVING THING THAT HAS EVER CONQUERED ME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-106 AND YOU ARE A HOPPER?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-107 SHE CONTINUED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-108 YES. MY PEOPLE LIVE IN A GREAT CITY NOT FAR FROM HERE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-109 WOULD YOU LIKE TO VISIT IT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-110 I'M NOT SURE SHE SAID WITH HESITATION.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-111 HAVE YOU ANY DARK WELLS IN YOUR CITY?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-112 I THINK NOT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-113 WE HAVE WELLS YOU KNOW BUT THEY'RE ALL WELL LIGHTED AND A WELL LIGHTED WELL CANNOT WELL BE A DARK WELL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-114 BUT THERE MAY BE SUCH A THING AS A VERY DARK WELL IN THE HORNER COUNTRY WHICH IS A BLACK SPOT ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-115 WHERE IS THE HORNER COUNTRY?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-116 OJO INQUIRED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-117 THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-118 THERE'S A FENCE BETWEEN THE HOPPER COUNTRY AND THE HORNER COUNTRY AND A GATE IN THE FENCE,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-119 BUT YOU CAN'T PASS THROUGH JUST NOW BECAUSE WE ARE AT WAR WITH THE HORNERS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-120 THAT'S TOO BAD SAID THE SCARECROW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-121 WHAT SEEMS TO BE THE TROUBLE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-122 WHY ONE OF THEM MADE A VERY INSULTING REMARK ABOUT MY PEOPLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-123 HE SAID WE WERE LACKING IN UNDERSTANDING BECAUSE WE HAD ONLY ONE LEG TO A PERSON.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-124 I CAN'T SEE THAT LEGS HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH UNDERSTANDING THINGS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-125 THE HORNERS EACH HAVE TWO LEGS JUST AS YOU HAVE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-126 THAT'S ONE LEG TOO MANY IT SEEMS TO ME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-127 NO DECLARED DOROTHY IT'S JUST THE RIGHT NUMBER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-128 YOU DON'T NEED THEM ARGUED THE HOPPER OBSTINATELY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-129 YOU'VE ONLY ONE HEAD AND ONE BODY AND ONE NOSE AND MOUTH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-130 TWO LEGS ARE QUITE UNNECESSARY AND THEY SPOIL ONE'S SHAPE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-131 BUT HOW CAN YOU WALK WITH ONLY ONE LEG?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-132 ASKED OJO. WALK!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-133 WHO WANTS TO WALK?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-134 EXCLAIMED THE MAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-135 WALKING IS A TERRIBLY AWKWARD WAY TO TRAVEL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-136 I HOP AND SO DO ALL MY PEOPLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-137 IT'S SO MUCH MORE GRACEFUL AND AGREEABLE THAN WALKING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-138 I DON'T AGREE WITH YOU SAID THE SCARECROW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-139 BUT TELL ME IS THERE ANY WAY TO GET TO THE HORNER COUNTRY WITHOUT GOING THROUGH THE CITY OF THE HOPPERS?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-140 YES,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-141 THERE IS ANOTHER PATH FROM THE ROCKY LOWLANDS OUTSIDE THE MOUNTAIN THAT LEADS STRAIGHT TO THE ENTRANCE OF THE HORNER COUNTRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-142 BUT IT'S A LONG WAY AROUND SO YOU'D BETTER COME WITH ME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-143 PERHAPS THEY WILL ALLOW YOU TO GO THROUGH THE GATE,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-144 BUT WE EXPECT TO CONQUER THEM THIS AFTERNOON IF WE GET TIME AND THEN YOU MAY GO AND COME AS YOU PLEASE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-145 THEY THOUGHT IT BEST TO TAKE THE HOPPER'S ADVICE AND ASKED HIM TO LEAD THE WAY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-21-146 THIS HE DID IN A SERIES OF HOPS AND HE MOVED SO SWIFTLY IN THIS STRANGE MANNER THAT THOSE WITH TWO LEGS HAD TO RUN TO KEEP UP WITH HIM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-01 CHAPTER TWENTY TWO THE JOKING HORNERS IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE THEY LEFT THE PASSAGE AND CAME TO A GREAT CAVE SO HIGH THAT IT MUST HAVE REACHED NEARLY TO THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN WITHIN WHICH IT LAY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-02 IT WAS A MAGNIFICENT CAVE ILLUMINED BY THE SOFT INVISIBLE LIGHT SO THAT EVERYTHING IN IT COULD BE PLAINLY SEEN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-03 THE WALLS WERE OF POLISHED MARBLE WHITE WITH VEINS OF DELICATE COLORS RUNNING THROUGH IT AND THE ROOF WAS ARCHED AND FANTASTIC AND BEAUTIFUL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-04 BUILT BENEATH THIS VAST DOME WAS A PRETTY VILLAGE NOT VERY LARGE FOR THERE SEEMED NOT MORE THAN FIFTY HOUSES ALTOGETHER AND THE DWELLINGS WERE OF MARBLE AND ARTISTICALLY DESIGNED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-05 NO GRASS NOR FLOWERS NOR TREES GREW IN THIS CAVE SO THE YARDS SURROUNDING THE HOUSES CARVED IN DESIGNS BOTH WERE SMOOTH AND BARE AND HAD LOW WALLS AROUND THEM TO MARK THEIR BOUNDARIES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-06 IN THE STREETS AND THE YARDS OF THE HOUSES WERE MANY PEOPLE ALL HAVING ONE LEG GROWING BELOW THEIR BODIES AND ALL HOPPING HERE AND THERE WHENEVER THEY MOVED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-07 EVEN THE CHILDREN STOOD FIRMLY UPON THEIR SINGLE LEGS AND NEVER LOST THEIR BALANCE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-08 ALL HAIL CHAMPION!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-09 CRIED A MAN IN THE FIRST GROUP OF HOPPERS THEY MET,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-10 WHOM HAVE YOU CAPTURED?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-11 NO ONE REPLIED THE CHAMPION IN A GLOOMY VOICE,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-12 THESE STRANGERS HAVE CAPTURED ME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-13 THEN SAID ANOTHER WE WILL RESCUE YOU AND CAPTURE THEM FOR WE ARE GREATER IN NUMBER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-14 NO ANSWERED THE CHAMPION I CAN'T ALLOW IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-15 I'VE SURRENDERED AND IT ISN'T POLITE TO CAPTURE THOSE YOU'VE SURRENDERED TO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-16 NEVER MIND THAT SAID DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-17 WE WILL GIVE YOU YOUR LIBERTY AND SET YOU FREE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-18 REALLY?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-19 ASKED THE CHAMPION IN JOYOUS TONES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-20 YES SAID THE LITTLE GIRL,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-21 YOUR PEOPLE MAY NEED YOU TO HELP CONQUER THE HORNERS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-22 AT THIS ALL THE HOPPERS LOOKED DOWNCAST AND SAD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-23 SEVERAL MORE HAD JOINED THE GROUP BY THIS TIME AND QUITE A CROWD OF CURIOUS MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN SURROUNDED THE STRANGERS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-24 THIS WAR WITH OUR NEIGHBORS IS A TERRIBLE THING REMARKED ONE OF THE WOMEN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-25 SOME ONE IS ALMOST SURE TO GET HURT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-26 WHY DO YOU SAY THAT MADAM?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-27 SCARECROW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-28 BECAUSE THE HORNS OF OUR ENEMIES ARE SHARP AND IN BATTLE THEY WILL TRY TO STICK THOSE HORNS INTO OUR WARRIORS SHE REPLIED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-29 HOW MANY HORNS DO THE HORNERS HAVE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-30 ASKED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-31 EACH HAS ONE HORN IN THE CENTER OF HIS FOREHEAD WAS THE ANSWER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-32 OH THEN THEY'RE UNICORNS DECLARED THE SCARECROW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-33 NO,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-34 THEY'RE HORNERS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-35 WE NEVER GO TO WAR WITH THEM IF WE CAN HELP IT ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR DANGEROUS HORNS,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-36 BUT THIS INSULT WAS SO GREAT AND SO UNPROVOKED THAT OUR BRAVE MEN DECIDED TO FIGHT IN ORDER TO BE REVENGED SAID THE WOMAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-37 WHAT WEAPONS DO YOU FIGHT WITH?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-38 THE SCARECROW ASKED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-39 WE HAVE NO WEAPONS EXPLAINED THE CHAMPION.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-40 WHENEVER WE FIGHT THE HORNERS OUR PLAN IS TO PUSH THEM BACK FOR OUR ARMS ARE LONGER THAN THEIRS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-41 THEN YOU ARE BETTER ARMED SAID SCRAPS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-42 YES,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-43 BUT THEY HAVE THOSE TERRIBLE HORNS AND UNLESS WE ARE CAREFUL THEY PRICK US WITH THE POINTS RETURNED THE CHAMPION WITH A SHUDDER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-44 THAT MAKES A WAR WITH THEM DANGEROUS AND A DANGEROUS WAR CANNOT BE A PLEASANT ONE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-45 I SEE VERY CLEARLY REMARKED THE SCARECROW THAT YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TROUBLE IN CONQUERING THOSE HORNERS UNLESS WE HELP YOU.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-46 OH!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-47 CRIED THE HOPPERS IN A CHORUS,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-48 CAN YOU HELP US?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-49 PLEASE DO!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-50 WE WILL BE GREATLY OBLIGED!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-51 IT WOULD PLEASE US VERY MUCH!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-52 AND BY THESE EXCLAMATIONS THE SCARECROW KNEW THAT HIS SPEECH HAD MET WITH FAVOR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-53 HOW FAR IS IT TO THE HORNER COUNTRY?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-54 HE ASKED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-55 WHY IT'S JUST THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FENCE THEY ANSWERED AND THE CHAMPION ADDED, COME WITH ME PLEASE AND I'LL SHOW YOU THE HORNERS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-56 SO THEY FOLLOWED THE CHAMPION AND SEVERAL OTHERS THROUGH THE STREETS AND JUST BEYOND THE VILLAGE CAME TO A VERY HIGH PICKET FENCE BUILT ALL OF MARBLE WHICH SEEMED TO DIVIDE THE GREAT CAVE INTO TWO EQUAL PARTS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-57 BUT THE PART INHABITED BY THE HORNERS WAS IN NO WAY AS GRAND IN APPEARANCE AS THAT OF THE HOPPERS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-58 INSTEAD OF BEING MARBLE THE WALLS AND ROOF WERE OF DULL GRAY ROCK AND THE SQUARE HOUSES WERE PLAINLY MADE OF THE SAME MATERIAL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-59 BUT IN EXTENT THE CITY WAS MUCH LARGER THAN THAT OF THE HOPPERS AND THE STREETS WERE THRONGED WITH NUMEROUS PEOPLE WHO BUSIED THEMSELVES IN VARIOUS WAYS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-60 LOOKING THROUGH THE OPEN PICKETS OF THE FENCE OUR FRIENDS WATCHED THE HORNERS WHO DID NOT KNOW THEY WERE BEING WATCHED BY STRANGERS AND FOUND THEM VERY UNUSUAL IN APPEARANCE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-61 THEY WERE LITTLE FOLKS IN SIZE AND HAD BODIES ROUND AS BALLS AND SHORT LEGS AND ARMS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-62 THEIR HEADS WERE ROUND TOO AND THEY HAD LONG POINTED EARS AND A HORN SET IN THE CENTER OF THE FOREHEAD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-63 THE HORNS DID NOT SEEM VERY TERRIBLE FOR THEY WERE NOT MORE THAN SIX INCHES LONG,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-64 BUT THEY WERE IVORY WHITE AND SHARP POINTED AND NO WONDER THE HOPPERS FEARED THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-65 THE SKINS OF THE HORNERS WERE LIGHT BROWN BUT THEY WORE SNOW WHITE ROBES AND WERE BARE FOOTED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-66 DOROTHY THOUGHT THE MOST STRIKING THING ABOUT THEM WAS THEIR HAIR WHICH GREW IN THREE DISTINCT COLORS ON EACH AND EVERY HEAD RED YELLOW AND GREEN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-67 THE RED WAS AT THE BOTTOM AND SOMETIMES HUNG OVER THEIR EYES,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-68 THEN CAME A BROAD CIRCLE OF YELLOW AND THE GREEN WAS AT THE TOP AND FORMED A BRUSH SHAPED TOP KNOT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-69 NONE OF THE HORNERS WAS YET AWARE OF THE PRESENCE OF STRANGERS WHO WATCHED THE LITTLE BROWN PEOPLE FOR A TIME AND THEN WENT TO THE BIG GATE IN THE CENTER OF THE DIVIDING FENCE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-70 IT WAS LOCKED ON BOTH SIDES AND OVER THE LATCH WAS A SIGN READING, WAR IS DECLARED CAN'T WE GO THROUGH?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-71 ASKED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-72 NOT NOW ANSWERED THE CHAMPION.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-73 I THINK SAID THE SCARECROW THAT IF I COULD TALK WITH THOSE HORNERS THEY WOULD APOLOGIZE TO YOU AND THEN THERE WOULD BE NO NEED TO FIGHT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-74 CAN'T YOU TALK FROM THIS SIDE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-75 ASKED THE CHAMPION.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-76 NOT SO WELL REPLIED THE SCARECROW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-77 DO YOU SUPPOSE YOU COULD THROW ME OVER THAT FENCE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-78 IT IS HIGH BUT I AM VERY LIGHT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-79 WE CAN TRY IT SAID THE HOPPER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-80 I AM PERHAPS THE STRONGEST MAN IN MY COUNTRY SO I'LL UNDERTAKE TO DO THE THROWING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-81 BUT I WON'T PROMISE YOU WILL LAND ON YOUR FEET.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-82 NO MATTER ABOUT THAT RETURNED THE SCARECROW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-83 JUST TOSS ME OVER AND I'LL BE SATISFIED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-84 SO THE CHAMPION PICKED UP THE SCARECROW AND BALANCED HIM A MOMENT TO SEE HOW MUCH HE WEIGHED AND THEN WITH ALL HIS STRENGTH TOSSED HIM HIGH INTO THE AIR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-85 PERHAPS IF THE SCARECROW HAD BEEN A TRIFLE HEAVIER HE WOULD HAVE BEEN EASIER TO THROW AND WOULD HAVE GONE A GREATER DISTANCE,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-86 BUT AS IT WAS INSTEAD OF GOING OVER THE FENCE HE LANDED JUST ON TOP OF IT AND ONE OF THE SHARP PICKETS CAUGHT HIM IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS BACK AND HELD HIM FAST PRISONER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-87 HAD HE BEEN FACE DOWNWARD THE SCARECROW MIGHT HAVE MANAGED TO FREE HIMSELF BUT LYING ON HIS BACK ON THE PICKET HIS HANDS WAVED IN THE AIR OF THE HORNER COUNTRY WHILE HIS FEET KICKED THE AIR OF THE HOPPER COUNTRY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-88 SO THERE HE WAS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-89 ARE YOU HURT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-90 CALLED THE PATCHWORK GIRL ANXIOUSLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-91 COURSE NOT SAID DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-92 BUT IF HE WIGGLES THAT WAY HE MAY TEAR HIS CLOTHES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-93 HOW CAN WE GET HIM DOWN MISTER CHAMPION?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-94 THE CHAMPION SHOOK HIS HEAD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-95 I DON'T KNOW HE CONFESSED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-96 IF HE COULD SCARE HORNERS AS WELL AS HE DOES CROWS IT MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA TO LEAVE HIM THERE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-97 THIS IS TERRIBLE SAID OJO ALMOST READY TO CRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-98 I S'POSE IT'S BECAUSE I AM OJO THE UNLUCKY THAT EVERYONE WHO TRIES TO HELP ME GETS INTO TROUBLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-99 YOU ARE LUCKY TO HAVE ANYONE TO HELP YOU DECLARED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-100 BUT DON'T WORRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-101 WE'LL RESCUE THE SCARECROW SOMEHOW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-102 I KNOW HOW ANNOUNCED SCRAPS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-103 HERE MISTER CHAMPION,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-104 JUST THROW ME UP TO THE SCARECROW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-105 I'M NEARLY AS LIGHT AS HE IS AND WHEN I'M ON TOP THE FENCE I'LL PULL OUR FRIEND OFF THE PICKET AND TOSS HIM DOWN TO YOU.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-106 ALL RIGHT SAID THE CHAMPION AND HE PICKED UP THE PATCHWORK GIRL AND THREW HER IN THE SAME MANNER HE HAD THE SCARECROW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-107 HE MUST HAVE USED MORE STRENGTH THIS TIME HOWEVER FOR SCRAPS SAILED FAR OVER THE TOP OF THE FENCE AND WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO GRAB THE SCARECROW AT ALL TUMBLED TO THE GROUND IN THE HORNER COUNTRY WHERE HER STUFFED BODY KNOCKED OVER TWO MEN AND A WOMAN AND MADE A CROWD THAT HAD COLLECTED THERE RUN LIKE RABBITS TO GET AWAY FROM HER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-108 SEEING THE NEXT MOMENT THAT SHE WAS HARMLESS THE PEOPLE SLOWLY RETURNED AND GATHERED AROUND THE PATCHWORK GIRL REGARDING HER WITH ASTONISHMENT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-109 ONE OF THEM WORE A JEWELED STAR IN HIS HAIR JUST ABOVE HIS HORN AND THIS SEEMED A PERSON OF IMPORTANCE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-110 HE SPOKE FOR THE REST OF HIS PEOPLE WHO TREATED HIM WITH GREAT RESPECT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-111 WHO ARE YOU UNKNOWN BEING?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-112 HE ASKED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-113 SCRAPS SHE SAID RISING TO HER FEET AND PATTING HER COTTON WADDING SMOOTH WHERE IT HAD BUNCHED UP.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-114 AND WHERE DID YOU COME FROM?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-115 HE CONTINUED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-116 OVER THE FENCE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-117 DON'T BE SILLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-118 THERE'S NO OTHER PLACE I COULD HAVE COME FROM SHE REPLIED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-119 HE LOOKED AT HER THOUGHTFULLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-120 YOU ARE NOT A HOPPER SAID HE FOR YOU HAVE TWO LEGS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-121 THEY'RE NOT VERY WELL SHAPED BUT THEY ARE TWO IN NUMBER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-122 AND THAT STRANGE CREATURE ON TOP THE FENCE WHY DOESN'T HE STOP KICKING?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-123 MUST BE YOUR BROTHER OR FATHER OR SON FOR HE ALSO HAS TWO LEGS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-124 YOU MUST HAVE BEEN TO VISIT THE WISE DONKEY SAID SCRAPS LAUGHING SO MERRILY THAT THE CROWD SMILED WITH HER IN SYMPATHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-125 BUT THAT REMINDS ME CAPTAIN OR KING I AM CHIEF OF THE HORNERS AND MY NAME IS JAK. OF COURSE,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-126 LITTLE JACK HORNER,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-127 I MIGHT HAVE KNOWN IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-128 BUT THE REASON I VOLPLANED OVER THE FENCE WAS SO I COULD HAVE A TALK WITH YOU ABOUT THE HOPPERS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-129 WHAT ABOUT THE HOPPERS?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-130 ASKED THE CHIEF FROWNING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-131 YOU'VE INSULTED THEM AND YOU'D BETTER BEG THEIR PARDON SAID SCRAPS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-132 IF YOU DON'T THEY'LL PROBABLY HOP OVER HERE AND CONQUER YOU.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-133 WE'RE NOT AFRAID AS LONG AS THE GATE IS LOCKED DECLARED THE CHIEF.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-134 AND WE DIDN'T INSULT THEM AT ALL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-135 ONE OF US MADE A JOKE THAT THE STUPID HOPPERS COULDN'T SEE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-136 THE CHIEF SMILED AS HE SAID THIS AND THE SMILE MADE HIS FACE LOOK QUITE JOLLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-137 WHAT WAS THE JOKE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-138 ASKED SCRAPS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-139 A HORNER SAID THEY HAVE LESS UNDERSTANDING THAN WE BECAUSE THEY'VE ONLY ONE LEG.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-140 HA HA!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-141 YOU SEE THE POINT DON'T YOU?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-142 IF YOU STAND ON YOUR LEGS AND YOUR LEGS ARE UNDER YOU THEN HA HA HA!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-143 THEN YOUR LEGS ARE YOUR UNDER STANDING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-144 HO HO!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-145 MY BUT THAT'S A FINE JOKE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-146 THE STUPID HOPPERS COULDN'T SEE IT!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-147 THEY COULDN'T SEE THAT WITH ONLY ONE LEG THEY MUST HAVE LESS UNDER STANDING THAN WE WHO HAVE TWO LEGS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-148 HEE HEE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-149 HO HO!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-150 THE CHIEF WIPED THE TEARS OF LAUGHTER FROM HIS EYES WITH THE BOTTOM HEM OF HIS WHITE ROBE AND ALL THE OTHER HORNERS WIPED THEIR EYES ON THEIR ROBES FOR THEY HAD LAUGHED JUST AS HEARTILY AS THEIR CHIEF AT THE ABSURD JOKE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-151 THEN SAID SCRAPS THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF THE UNDERSTANDING YOU MEANT LED TO THE MISUNDERSTANDING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-152 EXACTLY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-153 AND SO THERE'S NO NEED FOR US TO APOLOGIZE RETURNED THE CHIEF.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-154 NO NEED FOR AN APOLOGY PERHAPS BUT MUCH NEED FOR AN EXPLANATION SAID SCRAPS DECIDEDLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-155 YOU DON'T WANT WAR DO YOU?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-156 THE QUESTION IS WHO'S GOING TO EXPLAIN THE JOKE TO THE HORNERS?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-157 YOU KNOW IT SPOILS ANY JOKE TO BE OBLIGED TO EXPLAIN IT AND THIS IS THE BEST JOKE I EVER HEARD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-158 WHO MADE THE JOKE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-159 ASKED SCRAPS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-160 DIKSEY HORNER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-161 HE IS WORKING IN THE MINES JUST NOW BUT HE'LL BE HOME BEFORE LONG.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-162 SUPPOSE WE WAIT AND TALK WITH HIM ABOUT IT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-163 MAYBE HE'LL BE WILLING TO EXPLAIN HIS JOKE TO THE HOPPERS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-164 ALL RIGHT SAID SCRAPS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-165 I'LL WAIT IF DIKSEY ISN'T TOO LONG.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-166 NO HE'S SHORT,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-167 HE'S SHORTER THAN I AM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-168 SAY!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-169 THAT'S A BETTER JOKE THAN DIKSEY'S.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-170 HE WON'T BE TOO LONG BECAUSE HE'S SHORT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-171 HEE HO!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-172 THE OTHER HORNERS WHO WERE STANDING BY ROARED WITH LAUGHTER AND SEEMED TO LIKE THEIR CHIEF'S JOKE AS MUCH AS HE DID.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-22-173 SCRAPS THOUGHT IT WAS ODD THAT THEY COULD BE SO EASILY AMUSED BUT DECIDED THERE COULD BE LITTLE HARM IN PEOPLE WHO LAUGHED SO MERRILY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-01 CHAPTER TWENTY THREE PEACE IS DECLARED COME WITH ME TO MY DWELLING AND I'LL INTRODUCE YOU TO MY DAUGHTERS SAID THE CHIEF.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-02 WE'RE BRINGING THEM UP ACCORDING TO A BOOK OF RULES THAT WAS WRITTEN BY ONE OF OUR LEADING OLD BACHELORS AND EVERYONE SAYS THEY'RE A REMARKABLE LOT OF GIRLS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-03 SO SCRAPS ACCOMPANIED HIM ALONG THE STREET TO A HOUSE THAT SEEMED ON THE OUTSIDE EXCEPTIONALLY GRIMY AND DINGY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-04 THE STREETS OF THIS CITY WERE NOT PAVED NOR HAD ANY ATTEMPT BEEN MADE TO BEAUTIFY THE HOUSES OR THEIR SURROUNDINGS AND HAVING NOTICED THIS CONDITION SCRAPS WAS ASTONISHED WHEN THE CHIEF USHERED HER INTO HIS HOME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-05 HERE WAS NOTHING GRIMY OR FADED INDEED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-06 ON THE CONTRARY THE ROOM WAS OF DAZZLING BRILLIANCE AND BEAUTY FOR IT WAS LINED THROUGHOUT WITH AN EXQUISITE METAL THAT RESEMBLED TRANSLUCENT FROSTED SILVER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-07 THE SURFACE OF THIS METAL WAS HIGHLY ORNAMENTED IN RAISED DESIGNS REPRESENTING MEN ANIMALS FLOWERS AND TREES AND FROM THE METAL ITSELF WAS RADIATED THE SOFT LIGHT WHICH FLOODED THE ROOM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-08 ALL THE FURNITURE WAS MADE OF THE SAME GLORIOUS METAL AND SCRAPS ASKED WHAT IT WAS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-09 THAT'S RADIUM ANSWERED THE CHIEF.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-10 WE HORNERS SPEND ALL OUR TIME DIGGING RADIUM FROM THE MINES UNDER THIS MOUNTAIN AND WE USE IT TO DECORATE OUR HOMES AND MAKE THEM PRETTY AND COSY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-11 IT IS A MEDICINE TOO AND NO ONE CAN EVER BE SICK WHO LIVES NEAR RADIUM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-12 HAVE YOU PLENTY OF IT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-13 ASKED THE PATCHWORK GIRL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-14 MORE THAN WE CAN USE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-15 ALL THE HOUSES IN THIS CITY ARE DECORATED WITH IT JUST THE SAME AS MINE IS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-16 WHY DON'T YOU USE IT ON YOUR STREETS THEN AND THE OUTSIDE OF YOUR HOUSES TO MAKE THEM AS PRETTY AS THEY ARE WITHIN?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-17 SHE INQUIRED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-18 OUTSIDE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-19 WHO CARES FOR THE OUTSIDE OF ANYTHING?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-20 ASKED THE CHIEF.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-21 WE HORNERS DON'T LIVE ON THE OUTSIDE OF OUR HOMES,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-22 WE LIVE INSIDE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-23 MANY PEOPLE ARE LIKE THOSE STUPID HOPPERS WHO LOVE TO MAKE AN OUTSIDE SHOW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-24 I SUPPOSE YOU STRANGERS THOUGHT THEIR CITY MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN OURS BECAUSE YOU JUDGED FROM APPEARANCES AND THEY HAVE HANDSOME MARBLE HOUSES AND MARBLE STREETS,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-25 BUT IF YOU ENTERED ONE OF THEIR STIFF DWELLINGS YOU WOULD FIND IT BARE AND UNCOMFORTABLE AS ALL THEIR SHOW IS ON THE OUTSIDE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-26 THEY HAVE AN IDEA THAT WHAT IS NOT SEEN BY OTHERS IS NOT IMPORTANT BUT WITH US THE ROOMS WE LIVE IN ARE OUR CHIEF DELIGHT AND CARE AND WE PAY NO ATTENTION TO OUTSIDE SHOW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-27 SEEMS TO ME SAID SCRAPS MUSINGLY IT WOULD BE BETTER TO MAKE IT ALL PRETTY INSIDE AND OUT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-28 SEEMS?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-29 WHY YOU'RE ALL SEAMS MY GIRL!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-30 SAID THE CHIEF,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-31 AND THEN HE LAUGHED HEARTILY AT HIS LATEST JOKE AND A CHORUS OF SMALL VOICES ECHOED THE CHORUS WITH TEE HEE HEE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-32 HA HA!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-33 SCRAPS TURNED AROUND AND FOUND A ROW OF GIRLS SEATED IN RADIUM CHAIRS RANGED ALONG ONE WALL OF THE ROOM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-34 THERE WERE NINETEEN OF THEM BY ACTUAL COUNT AND THEY WERE OF ALL SIZES FROM A TINY CHILD TO ONE ALMOST A GROWN WOMAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-35 ALL WERE NEATLY DRESSED IN SPOTLESS WHITE ROBES AND HAD BROWN SKINS HORNS ON THEIR FOREHEADS AND THREE COLORED HAIR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-36 THESE SAID THE CHIEF ARE MY SWEET DAUGHTERS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-37 MY DEARS I INTRODUCE TO YOU MISS SCRAPS PATCHWORK A LADY WHO IS TRAVELING IN FOREIGN PARTS TO INCREASE HER STORE OF WISDOM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-38 THE NINETEEN HORNER GIRLS ALL AROSE AND MADE A POLITE CURTSEY AFTER WHICH THEY RESUMED THEIR SEATS AND REARRANGED THEIR ROBES PROPERLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-39 WHY DO THEY SIT SO STILL AND ALL IN A ROW?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-40 ASKED SCRAPS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-41 BECAUSE IT IS LADYLIKE AND PROPER REPLIED THE CHIEF.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-42 BUT SOME ARE JUST CHILDREN POOR THINGS!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-43 DON'T THEY EVER RUN AROUND AND PLAY AND LAUGH AND HAVE A GOOD TIME?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-44 NO INDEED SAID THE CHIEF.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-45 THAT WOULD BE IMPROPER IN YOUNG LADIES AS WELL AS IN THOSE WHO WILL SOMETIME BECOME YOUNG LADIES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-46 MY DAUGHTERS ARE BEING BROUGHT UP ACCORDING TO THE RULES AND REGULATIONS LAID DOWN BY A LEADING BACHELOR WHO HAS GIVEN THE SUBJECT MUCH STUDY AND IS HIMSELF A MAN OF TASTE AND CULTURE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-47 POLITENESS IS HIS GREAT HOBBY AND HE CLAIMS THAT IF A CHILD IS ALLOWED TO DO AN IMPOLITE THING ONE CANNOT EXPECT THE GROWN PERSON TO DO ANYTHING BETTER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-48 IS IT IMPOLITE TO ROMP AND SHOUT AND BE JOLLY?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-49 ASKED SCRAPS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-50 WELL SOMETIMES IT IS AND SOMETIMES IT ISN'T REPLIED THE HORNER AFTER CONSIDERING THE QUESTION.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-51 BY CURBING SUCH INCLINATIONS IN MY DAUGHTERS WE KEEP ON THE SAFE SIDE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-52 ONCE IN A WHILE I MAKE A GOOD JOKE AS YOU HAVE HEARD AND THEN I PERMIT MY DAUGHTERS TO LAUGH DECOROUSLY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-53 BUT THEY ARE NEVER ALLOWED TO MAKE A JOKE THEMSELVES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-54 THAT OLD BACHELOR WHO MADE THE RULES OUGHT TO BE SKINNED ALIVE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-55 DECLARED SCRAPS AND WOULD HAVE SAID MORE ON THE SUBJECT HAD NOT THE DOOR OPENED TO ADMIT A LITTLE HORNER MAN WHOM THE CHIEF INTRODUCED AS DIKSEY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-56 WHAT'S UP CHIEF?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-57 ASKED DIKSEY WINKING NINETEEN TIMES AT THE NINETEEN GIRLS WHO DEMURELY CAST DOWN THEIR EYES BECAUSE THEIR FATHER WAS LOOKING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-58 THE CHIEF TOLD THE MAN THAT HIS JOKE HAD NOT BEEN UNDERSTOOD BY THE DULL HOPPERS WHO HAD BECOME SO ANGRY THAT THEY HAD DECLARED WAR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-59 SO THE ONLY WAY TO AVOID A TERRIBLE BATTLE WAS TO EXPLAIN THE JOKE SO THEY COULD UNDERSTAND IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-60 ALL RIGHT REPLIED DIKSEY WHO SEEMED A GOOD NATURED MAN,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-61 I'LL GO AT ONCE TO THE FENCE AND EXPLAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-62 I DON'T WANT ANY WAR WITH THE HOPPERS FOR WARS BETWEEN NATIONS ALWAYS CAUSE HARD FEELINGS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-63 SO THE CHIEF AND DIKSEY AND SCRAPS LEFT THE HOUSE AND WENT BACK TO THE MARBLE PICKET FENCE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-64 THE SCARECROW WAS STILL STUCK ON THE TOP OF HIS PICKET BUT HAD NOW CEASED TO STRUGGLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-65 ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FENCE WERE DOROTHY AND OJO LOOKING BETWEEN THE PICKETS,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-66 AND THERE ALSO WERE THE CHAMPION AND MANY OTHER HOPPERS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-67 DIKSEY WENT CLOSE TO THE FENCE AND SAID, MY GOOD HOPPERS I WISH TO EXPLAIN THAT WHAT I SAID ABOUT YOU WAS A JOKE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-68 YOU HAVE BUT ONE LEG EACH AND WE HAVE TWO LEGS EACH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-69 OUR LEGS ARE UNDER US WHETHER ONE OR TWO AND WE STAND ON THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-70 SO WHEN I SAID YOU HAD LESS UNDERSTANDING THAN WE I DID NOT MEAN THAT YOU HAD LESS UNDERSTANDING YOU UNDERSTAND BUT THAT YOU HAD LESS STANDUNDERING SO TO SPEAK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-71 DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-72 THE HOPPERS THOUGHT IT OVER CAREFULLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-73 THEN ONE SAID, THAT IS CLEAR ENOUGH,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-74 BUT WHERE DOES THE JOKE COME IN?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-75 DOROTHY LAUGHED FOR SHE COULDN'T HELP IT ALTHOUGH ALL THE OTHERS WERE SOLEMN ENOUGH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-76 I'LL TELL YOU WHERE THE JOKE COMES IN SHE SAID AND TOOK THE HOPPERS AWAY TO A DISTANCE WHERE THE HORNERS COULD NOT HEAR THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-77 YOU KNOW SHE THEN EXPLAINED THOSE NEIGHBORS OF YOURS ARE NOT VERY BRIGHT POOR THINGS AND WHAT THEY THINK IS A JOKE ISN'T A JOKE AT ALL IT'S TRUE DON'T YOU SEE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-78 TRUE THAT WE HAVE LESS UNDERSTANDING?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-79 ASKED THE CHAMPION.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-80 YES,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-81 IT'S TRUE BECAUSE YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND SUCH A POOR JOKE,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-82 IF YOU DID YOU'D BE NO WISER THAN THEY ARE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-83 AH YES,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-84 OF COURSE THEY ANSWERED LOOKING VERY WISE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-85 SO I'LL TELL YOU WHAT TO DO CONTINUED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-86 LAUGH AT THEIR POOR JOKE AND TELL EM IT'S PRETTY GOOD FOR A HORNER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-87 THEN THEY WON'T DARE SAY YOU HAVE LESS UNDERSTANDING BECAUSE YOU UNDERSTAND AS MUCH AS THEY DO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-88 THE HOPPERS LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER QUESTIONINGLY AND BLINKED THEIR EYES AND TRIED TO THINK WHAT IT ALL MEANT,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-89 BUT THEY COULDN'T FIGURE IT OUT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-90 WHAT DO YOU THINK CHAMPION?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-91 ASKED ONE OF THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-92 I THINK IT IS DANGEROUS TO THINK OF THIS THING ANY MORE THAN WE CAN HELP HE REPLIED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-93 LET US DO AS THIS GIRL SAYS AND LAUGH WITH THE HORNERS SO AS TO MAKE THEM BELIEVE WE SEE THE JOKE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-94 THEN THERE WILL BE PEACE AGAIN AND NO NEED TO FIGHT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-95 THEY READILY AGREED TO THIS AND RETURNED TO THE FENCE LAUGHING AS LOUD AND AS HARD AS THEY COULD ALTHOUGH THEY DIDN'T FEEL LIKE LAUGHING A BIT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-96 THE HORNERS WERE MUCH SURPRISED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-97 THAT'S A FINE JOKE FOR A HORNER AND WE ARE MUCH PLEASED WITH IT SAID THE CHAMPION SPEAKING BETWEEN THE PICKETS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-98 BUT PLEASE DON'T DO IT AGAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-99 I WON'T PROMISED DIKSEY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-100 IF I THINK OF ANOTHER SUCH JOKE I'LL TRY TO FORGET IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-101 GOOD!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-102 CRIED THE CHIEF HORNER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-103 THE WAR IS OVER AND PEACE IS DECLARED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-104 THERE WAS MUCH JOYFUL SHOUTING ON BOTH SIDES OF THE FENCE AND THE GATE WAS UNLOCKED AND THROWN WIDE OPEN SO THAT SCRAPS WAS ABLE TO REJOIN HER FRIENDS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-105 WHAT ABOUT THE SCARECROW?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-106 SHE ASKED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-107 WE MUST GET HIM DOWN SOMEHOW OR OTHER WAS THE REPLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-108 PERHAPS THE HORNERS CAN FIND A WAY SUGGESTED OJO. SO THEY ALL WENT THROUGH THE GATE AND DOROTHY ASKED THE CHIEF HORNER HOW THEY COULD GET THE SCARECROW OFF THE FENCE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-109 THE CHIEF DIDN'T KNOW HOW BUT DIKSEY SAID, A LADDER'S THE THING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-110 HAVE YOU ONE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-111 ASKED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-112 TO BE SURE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-113 WE USE LADDERS IN OUR MINES SAID HE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-114 THEN HE RAN AWAY TO GET THE LADDER AND WHILE HE WAS GONE THE HORNERS GATHERED AROUND AND WELCOMED THE STRANGERS TO THEIR COUNTRY FOR THROUGH THEM A GREAT WAR HAD BEEN AVOIDED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-115 IN A LITTLE WHILE DIKSEY CAME BACK WITH A TALL LADDER WHICH HE PLACED AGAINST THE FENCE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-116 OJO AT ONCE CLIMBED TO THE TOP OF THE LADDER AND DOROTHY WENT ABOUT HALFWAY UP AND SCRAPS STOOD AT THE FOOT OF IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-117 TOTO RAN AROUND IT AND BARKED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-118 THEN OJO PULLED THE SCARECROW AWAY FROM THE PICKET AND PASSED HIM DOWN TO DOROTHY WHO IN TURN LOWERED HIM TO THE PATCHWORK GIRL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-119 AS SOON AS HE WAS ON HIS FEET AND STANDING ON SOLID GROUND THE SCARECROW SAID, MUCH OBLIGED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-120 I FEEL MUCH BETTER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-121 I'M NOT STUCK ON THAT PICKET ANY MORE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-122 THE HORNERS BEGAN TO LAUGH THINKING THIS WAS A JOKE BUT THE SCARECROW SHOOK HIMSELF AND PATTED HIS STRAW A LITTLE AND SAID TO DOROTHY, IS THERE MUCH OF A HOLE IN MY BACK?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-123 THE LITTLE GIRL EXAMINED HIM CAREFULLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-124 THERE'S QUITE A HOLE SHE SAID.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-125 BUT I'VE GOT A NEEDLE AND THREAD IN THE KNAPSACK AND I'LL SEW YOU UP AGAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-126 DO SO HE BEGGED EARNESTLY AND AGAIN THE HOPPERS LAUGHED TO THE SCARECROW'S GREAT ANNOYANCE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-127 WHILE DOROTHY WAS SEWING UP THE HOLE IN THE STRAW MAN'S BACK SCRAPS EXAMINED THE OTHER PARTS OF HIM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-128 ONE OF HIS LEGS IS RIPPED TOO!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-129 SHE EXCLAIMED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-130 OHO!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-131 CRIED LITTLE DIKSEY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-132 THAT'S BAD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-133 GIVE HIM THE NEEDLE AND THREAD AND LET HIM MEND HIS WAYS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-134 HA HA HA!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-135 LAUGHED THE CHIEF AND THE OTHER HORNERS AT ONCE ROARED WITH LAUGHTER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-136 WHAT'S FUNNY?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-137 INQUIRED THE SCARECROW STERNLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-138 DON'T YOU SEE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-139 ASKED DIKSEY WHO HAD LAUGHED EVEN HARDER THAN THE OTHERS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-140 THAT'S A JOKE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-141 IT'S BY ODDS THE BEST JOKE I EVER MADE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-142 YOU WALK WITH YOUR LEGS AND SO THAT'S THE WAY YOU WALK AND YOUR LEGS ARE THE WAYS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-143 SEE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-144 SO WHEN YOU MEND YOUR LEGS YOU MEND YOUR WAYS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-145 HEE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-146 I'D NO IDEA I COULD MAKE SUCH A FINE JOKE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-147 JUST WONDERFUL!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-148 ECHOED THE CHIEF.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-149 HOW DO YOU MANAGE TO DO IT DIKSEY?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-150 DON'T KNOW SAID DIKSEY MODESTLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-151 PERHAPS IT'S THE RADIUM BUT I RATHER THINK IT'S MY SPLENDID INTELLECT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-152 IF YOU DON'T QUIT IT THE SCARECROW TOLD HIM THERE'LL BE A WORSE WAR THAN THE ONE YOU'VE ESCAPED FROM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-153 OJO HAD BEEN DEEP IN THOUGHT AND NOW HE ASKED THE CHIEF, IS THERE A DARK WELL IN ANY PART OF YOUR COUNTRY?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-154 A DARK WELL?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-155 NONE THAT EVER I HEARD OF WAS THE ANSWER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-156 OH YES SAID DIKSEY WHO OVERHEARD THE BOY'S QUESTION.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-157 THERE'S A VERY DARK WELL DOWN IN MY RADIUM MINE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-158 IS THERE ANY WATER IN IT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-159 OJO EAGERLY ASKED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-160 CAN'T SAY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-161 I'VE NEVER LOOKED TO SEE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-162 BUT WE CAN FIND OUT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-163 SO AS SOON AS THE SCARECROW WAS MENDED THEY DECIDED TO GO WITH DIKSEY TO THE MINE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-164 WHEN DOROTHY HAD PATTED THE STRAW MAN INTO SHAPE AGAIN HE DECLARED HE FELT AS GOOD AS NEW AND EQUAL TO FURTHER ADVENTURES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-165 STILL SAID HE I PREFER NOT TO DO PICKET DUTY AGAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-166 HIGH LIFE DOESN'T SEEM TO AGREE WITH MY CONSTITUTION.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-23-167 AND THEN THEY HURRIED AWAY TO ESCAPE THE LAUGHTER OF THE HORNERS WHO THOUGHT THIS WAS ANOTHER JOKE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-24-01 CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR OJO FINDS THE DARK WELL THEY NOW FOLLOWED DIKSEY TO THE FARTHER END OF THE GREAT CAVE BEYOND THE HORNER CITY WHERE THERE WERE SEVERAL ROUND DARK HOLES LEADING INTO THE GROUND IN A SLANTING DIRECTION.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-24-02 DIKSEY WENT TO ONE OF THESE HOLES AND SAID, HERE IS THE MINE IN WHICH LIES THE DARK WELL YOU ARE SEEKING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-24-03 FOLLOW ME AND STEP CAREFULLY AND I'LL LEAD YOU TO THE PLACE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-24-04 HE WENT IN FIRST AND AFTER HIM CAME OJO AND THEN DOROTHY WITH THE SCARECROW BEHIND HER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-24-05 THE PATCHWORK GIRL ENTERED LAST OF ALL FOR TOTO KEPT CLOSE BESIDE HIS LITTLE MISTRESS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-24-06 A FEW STEPS BEYOND THE MOUTH OF THE OPENING IT WAS PITCH DARK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-24-07 YOU WON'T LOSE YOUR WAY THOUGH SAID THE HORNER FOR THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO GO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-24-08 THE MINE'S MINE AND I KNOW EVERY STEP OF THE WAY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-24-09 HOW'S THAT FOR A JOKE EH?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-24-10 THE MINE'S MINE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-24-11 THEN HE CHUCKLED GLEEFULLY AS THEY FOLLOWED HIM SILENTLY DOWN THE STEEP SLANT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-24-12 THE HOLE WAS JUST BIG ENOUGH TO PERMIT THEM TO WALK UPRIGHT ALTHOUGH THE SCARECROW BEING MUCH THE TALLER OF THE PARTY OFTEN HAD TO BEND HIS HEAD TO KEEP FROM HITTING THE TOP.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-24-13 THE FLOOR OF THE TUNNEL WAS DIFFICULT TO WALK UPON BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN WORN SMOOTH AS GLASS AND PRETTY SOON SCRAPS WHO WAS SOME DISTANCE BEHIND THE OTHERS SLIPPED AND FELL HEAD FOREMOST.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-24-14 AT ONCE SHE BEGAN TO SLIDE DOWNWARD SO SWIFTLY THAT WHEN SHE CAME TO THE SCARECROW SHE KNOCKED HIM OFF HIS FEET AND SENT HIM TUMBLING AGAINST DOROTHY WHO TRIPPED UP OJO. THE BOY FELL AGAINST THE HORNER SO THAT ALL WENT TUMBLING DOWN THE SLIDE IN A REGULAR MIX UP UNABLE TO SEE WHERE THEY WERE GOING BECAUSE OF THE DARKNESS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-24-15 FORTUNATELY WHEN THEY REACHED THE BOTTOM THE SCARECROW AND SCRAPS WERE IN FRONT AND THE OTHERS BUMPED AGAINST THEM SO THAT NO ONE WAS HURT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-24-16 THEY FOUND THEMSELVES IN A VAST CAVE WHICH WAS DIMLY LIGHTED BY THE TINY GRAINS OF RADIUM THAT LAY SCATTERED AMONG THE LOOSE ROCKS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-24-17 NOW SAID DIKSEY WHEN THEY HAD ALL REGAINED THEIR FEET I WILL SHOW YOU WHERE THE DARK WELL IS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-24-18 THIS IS A BIG PLACE BUT IF WE HOLD FAST TO EACH OTHER WE WON'T GET LOST.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-24-19 THEY TOOK HOLD OF HANDS AND THE HORNER LED THEM INTO A DARK CORNER WHERE HE HALTED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-24-20 BE CAREFUL SAID HE WARNINGLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-24-21 THE WELL IS AT YOUR FEET.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-24-22 ALL RIGHT REPLIED OJO AND KNEELING DOWN HE FELT IN THE WELL WITH HIS HAND AND FOUND THAT IT CONTAINED A QUANTITY OF WATER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-24-23 WHERE'S THE GOLD FLASK DOROTHY?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-24-24 HE ASKED AND THE LITTLE GIRL HANDED HIM THE FLASK WHICH SHE HAD BROUGHT WITH HER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-24-25 OJO KNELT AGAIN AND BY FEELING CAREFULLY IN THE DARK MANAGED TO FILL THE FLASK WITH THE UNSEEN WATER THAT WAS IN THE WELL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-24-26 THEN HE SCREWED THE TOP OF THE FLASK FIRMLY IN PLACE AND PUT THE PRECIOUS WATER IN HIS POCKET.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-24-27 ALL RIGHT!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-24-28 HE SAID AGAIN IN A GLAD VOICE,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-24-29 NOW WE CAN GO BACK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-24-30 THEY RETURNED TO THE MOUTH OF THE TUNNEL AND BEGAN TO CREEP CAUTIOUSLY UP THE INCLINE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-24-31 THIS TIME THEY MADE SCRAPS STAY BEHIND FOR FEAR SHE WOULD SLIP AGAIN,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-24-32 BUT THEY ALL MANAGED TO GET UP IN SAFETY AND THE MUNCHKIN BOY WAS VERY HAPPY WHEN HE STOOD IN THE HORNER CITY AND REALIZED THAT THE WATER FROM THE DARK WELL WHICH HE AND HIS FRIENDS HAD TRAVELED SO FAR TO SECURE WAS SAFE IN HIS JACKET POCKET.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-01 CHAPTER TWENTY FIVE THEY BRIBE THE LAZY QUADLING NOW SAID DOROTHY AS THEY STOOD ON THE MOUNTAIN PATH HAVING LEFT BEHIND THEM THE CAVE IN WHICH DWELT THE HOPPERS AND THE HORNERS I THINK WE MUST FIND A ROAD INTO THE COUNTRY OF THE WINKIES FOR THERE IS WHERE OJO WANTS TO GO NEXT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-02 IS THERE SUCH A ROAD?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-03 ASKED THE SCARECROW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-04 I DON'T KNOW SHE REPLIED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-05 I S'POSE WE CAN GO BACK THE WAY WE CAME TO JACK PUMPKINHEAD'S HOUSE AND THEN TURN INTO THE WINKIE COUNTRY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-06 BUT THAT SEEMS LIKE RUNNING ROUND A HAYSTACK DOESN'T IT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-07 YES SAID THE SCARECROW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-08 WHAT IS THE NEXT THING OJO MUST GET?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-09 A YELLOW BUTTERFLY ANSWERED THE BOY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-10 THAT MEANS THE WINKIE COUNTRY ALL RIGHT FOR IT'S THE YELLOW COUNTRY OF OZ REMARKED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-11 I THINK SCARECROW WE OUGHT TO TAKE HIM TO THE TIN WOODMAN FOR HE'S THE EMP'ROR OF THE WINKIES AND WILL HELP US TO FIND WHAT OJO WANTS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-12 OF COURSE REPLIED THE SCARECROW BRIGHTENING AT THE SUGGESTION.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-13 THE TIN WOODMAN WILL DO ANYTHING WE ASK HIM FOR HE'S ONE OF MY DEAREST FRIENDS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-14 I BELIEVE WE CAN TAKE A CROSSCUT INTO HIS COUNTRY AND SO GET TO HIS CASTLE A DAY SOONER THAN IF WE TRAVEL BACK THE WAY WE CAME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-15 I THINK SO TOO SAID THE GIRL,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-16 AND THAT MEANS WE MUST KEEP TO THE LEFT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-17 THEY WERE OBLIGED TO GO DOWN THE MOUNTAIN BEFORE THEY FOUND ANY PATH THAT LED IN THE DIRECTION THEY WANTED TO GO BUT AMONG THE TUMBLED ROCKS AT THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAIN WAS A FAINT TRAIL WHICH THEY DECIDED TO FOLLOW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-18 TWO OR THREE HOURS WALK ALONG THIS TRAIL BROUGHT THEM TO A CLEAR LEVEL COUNTRY WHERE THERE WERE A FEW FARMS AND SOME SCATTERED HOUSES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-19 BUT THEY KNEW THEY WERE STILL IN THE COUNTRY OF THE QUADLINGS BECAUSE EVERYTHING HAD A BRIGHT RED COLOR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-20 NOT THAT THE TREES AND GRASSES WERE RED BUT THE FENCES AND HOUSES WERE PAINTED THAT COLOR AND ALL THE WILD FLOWERS THAT BLOOMED BY THE WAYSIDE HAD RED BLOSSOMS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-21 THIS PART OF THE QUADLING COUNTRY SEEMED PEACEFUL AND PROSPEROUS IF RATHER LONELY AND THE ROAD WAS MORE DISTINCT AND EASIER TO FOLLOW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-22 BUT JUST AS THEY WERE CONGRATULATING THEMSELVES UPON THE PROGRESS THEY HAD MADE THEY CAME UPON A BROAD RIVER WHICH SWEPT ALONG BETWEEN HIGH BANKS AND HERE THE ROAD ENDED AND THERE WAS NO BRIDGE OF ANY SORT TO ALLOW THEM TO CROSS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-23 THIS IS QUEER MUSED DOROTHY LOOKING AT THE WATER REFLECTIVELY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-24 WHY SHOULD THERE BE ANY ROAD IF THE RIVER STOPS EVERYONE WALKING ALONG IT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-25 WOW!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-26 SAID TOTO GAZING EARNESTLY INTO HER FACE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-27 THAT'S THE BEST ANSWER YOU'LL GET DECLARED THE SCARECROW WITH HIS COMICAL SMILE FOR NO ONE KNOWS ANY MORE THAN TOTO ABOUT THIS ROAD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-28 SAID SCRAPS, EV'RY TIME I SEE A RIVER I HAVE CHILLS THAT MAKE ME SHIVER FOR I NEVER CAN FORGET ALL THE WATER'S VERY WET.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-29 IF MY PATCHES GET A SOAK IT WILL BE A SORRY JOKE,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-30 SO TO SWIM I'LL NEVER TRY TILL I FIND THE WATER DRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-31 TRY TO CONTROL YOURSELF SCRAPS SAID OJO,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-32 YOU'RE GETTING CRAZY AGAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-33 NO ONE INTENDS TO SWIM THAT RIVER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-34 NO DECIDED DOROTHY WE COULDN'T SWIM IT IF WE TRIED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-35 IT'S TOO BIG A RIVER AND THE WATER MOVES AWFUL FAST.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-36 THERE OUGHT TO BE A FERRYMAN WITH A BOAT SAID THE SCARECROW,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-37 BUT I DON'T SEE ANY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-38 COULDN'T WE MAKE A RAFT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-39 SUGGESTED OJO. THERE'S NOTHING TO MAKE ONE OF ANSWERED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-40 WOW!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-41 SAID TOTO AGAIN AND DOROTHY SAW HE WAS LOOKING ALONG THE BANK OF THE RIVER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-42 WHY HE SEES A HOUSE OVER THERE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-43 CRIED THE LITTLE GIRL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-44 I WONDER WE DIDN'T NOTICE IT OURSELVES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-45 LET'S GO AND ASK THE PEOPLE HOW TO GET CROSS THE RIVER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-46 A QUARTER OF A MILE ALONG THE BANK STOOD A SMALL ROUND HOUSE PAINTED BRIGHT RED AND AS IT WAS ON THEIR SIDE OF THE RIVER THEY HURRIED TOWARD IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-47 A CHUBBY LITTLE MAN DRESSED ALL IN RED CAME OUT TO GREET THEM AND WITH HIM WERE TWO CHILDREN ALSO IN RED COSTUMES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-48 THE MAN'S EYES WERE BIG AND STARING AS HE EXAMINED THE SCARECROW AND THE PATCHWORK GIRL AND THE CHILDREN SHYLY HID BEHIND HIM AND PEEKED TIMIDLY AT TOTO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-49 DO YOU LIVE HERE MY GOOD MAN?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-50 ASKED THE SCARECROW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-51 I THINK I DO MOST MIGHTY MAGICIAN REPLIED THE QUADLING BOWING LOW,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-52 BUT WHETHER I'M AWAKE OR DREAMING I CAN'T BE POSITIVE SO I'M NOT SURE WHERE I LIVE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-53 IF YOU'LL KINDLY PINCH ME I'LL FIND OUT ALL ABOUT IT!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-54 YOU'RE AWAKE SAID DOROTHY AND THIS IS NO MAGICIAN BUT JUST THE SCARECROW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-55 BUT HE'S ALIVE PROTESTED THE MAN AND HE OUGHTN'T TO BE YOU KNOW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-56 AND THAT OTHER DREADFUL PERSON THE GIRL WHO IS ALL PATCHES SEEMS TO BE ALIVE TOO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-57 VERY MUCH SO DECLARED SCRAPS MAKING A FACE AT HIM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-58 BUT THAT ISN'T YOUR AFFAIR YOU KNOW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-59 I'VE A RIGHT TO BE SURPRISED HAVEN'T I?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-60 ASKED THE MAN MEEKLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-61 I'M NOT SURE,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-62 BUT ANYHOW YOU'VE NO RIGHT TO SAY I'M DREADFUL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-63 THE SCARECROW WHO IS A GENTLEMAN OF GREAT WISDOM THINKS I'M BEAUTIFUL RETORTED SCRAPS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-64 NEVER MIND ALL THAT SAID DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-65 TELL US GOOD QUADLING HOW WE CAN GET ACROSS THE RIVER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-66 I DON'T KNOW REPLIED THE QUADLING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-67 DON'T YOU EVER CROSS IT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-68 ASKED THE GIRL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-69 NEVER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-70 DON'T TRAVELERS CROSS IT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-71 NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE SAID HE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-72 THEY WERE MUCH SURPRISED TO HEAR THIS AND THE MAN ADDED, IT'S A PRETTY BIG RIVER AND THE CURRENT IS STRONG.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-73 I KNOW A MAN WHO LIVES ON THE OPPOSITE BANK FOR I'VE SEEN HIM THERE A GOOD MANY YEARS,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-74 BUT WE'VE NEVER SPOKEN BECAUSE NEITHER OF US HAS EVER CROSSED OVER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-75 THAT'S QUEER SAID THE SCARECROW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-76 DON'T YOU OWN A BOAT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-77 THE MAN SHOOK HIS HEAD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-78 NOR A RAFT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-79 WHERE DOES THIS RIVER GO TO?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-80 ASKED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-81 THAT WAY ANSWERED THE MAN POINTING WITH ONE HAND IT GOES INTO THE COUNTRY OF THE WINKIES WHICH IS RULED BY THE TIN EMPEROR WHO MUST BE A MIGHTY MAGICIAN BECAUSE HE'S ALL MADE OF TIN AND YET HE'S ALIVE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-82 AND THAT WAY POINTING WITH THE OTHER HAND THE RIVER RUNS BETWEEN TWO MOUNTAINS WHERE DANGEROUS PEOPLE DWELL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-83 THE SCARECROW LOOKED AT THE WATER BEFORE THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-84 THE CURRENT FLOWS TOWARD THE WINKIE COUNTRY SAID HE,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-85 AND SO IF WE HAD A BOAT OR A RAFT THE RIVER WOULD FLOAT US THERE MORE QUICKLY AND MORE EASILY THAN WE COULD WALK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-86 THAT IS TRUE AGREED DOROTHY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-87 AND THEN THEY ALL LOOKED THOUGHTFUL AND WONDERED WHAT COULD BE DONE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-88 WHY CAN'T THE MAN MAKE US A RAFT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-89 ASKED OJO. WILL YOU?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-90 INQUIRED DOROTHY TURNING TO THE QUADLING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-91 THE CHUBBY MAN SHOOK HIS HEAD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-92 I'M TOO LAZY HE SAID.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-93 MY WIFE SAYS I'M THE LAZIEST MAN IN ALL OZ AND SHE IS A TRUTHFUL WOMAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-94 I HATE WORK OF ANY KIND AND MAKING A RAFT IS HARD WORK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-95 I'LL GIVE YOU MY EM'RALD RING PROMISED THE GIRL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-96 NO,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-97 I DON'T CARE FOR EMERALDS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-98 IF IT WERE A RUBY WHICH IS THE COLOR I LIKE BEST I MIGHT WORK A LITTLE WHILE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-99 I'VE GOT SOME SQUARE MEAL TABLETS SAID THE SCARECROW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-100 EACH ONE IS THE SAME AS A DISH OF SOUP A FRIED FISH A MUTTON POT PIE LOBSTER SALAD CHARLOTTE RUSSE AND LEMON JELLY ALL MADE INTO ONE LITTLE TABLET THAT YOU CAN SWALLOW WITHOUT TROUBLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-101 WITHOUT TROUBLE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-102 EXCLAIMED THE QUADLING MUCH INTERESTED,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-103 THEN THOSE TABLETS WOULD BE FINE FOR A LAZY MAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-104 IT'S SUCH HARD WORK TO CHEW WHEN YOU EAT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-105 I'LL GIVE YOU SIX OF THOSE TABLETS IF YOU'LL HELP US MAKE A RAFT PROMISED THE SCARECROW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-106 THEY'RE A COMBINATION OF FOOD WHICH PEOPLE WHO EAT ARE VERY FOND OF.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-107 I NEVER EAT YOU KNOW BEING STRAW,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-108 BUT SOME OF MY FRIENDS EAT REGULARLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-109 WHAT DO YOU SAY TO MY OFFER QUADLING?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-110 I'LL DO IT DECIDED THE MAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-111 I'LL HELP AND YOU CAN DO MOST OF THE WORK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-112 BUT MY WIFE HAS GONE FISHING FOR RED EELS TO DAY SO SOME OF YOU WILL HAVE TO MIND THE CHILDREN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-113 SCRAPS PROMISED TO DO THAT AND THE CHILDREN WERE NOT SO SHY WHEN THE PATCHWORK GIRL SAT DOWN TO PLAY WITH THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-114 THEY GREW TO LIKE TOTO TOO AND THE LITTLE DOG ALLOWED THEM TO PAT HIM ON HIS HEAD WHICH GAVE THE LITTLE ONES MUCH JOY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-115 THERE WERE A NUMBER OF FALLEN TREES NEAR THE HOUSE AND THE QUADLING GOT HIS AXE AND CHOPPED THEM INTO LOGS OF EQUAL LENGTH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-116 HE TOOK HIS WIFE'S CLOTHESLINE TO BIND THESE LOGS TOGETHER SO THAT THEY WOULD FORM A RAFT AND OJO FOUND SOME STRIPS OF WOOD AND NAILED THEM ALONG THE TOPS OF THE LOGS TO RENDER THEM MORE FIRM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-117 THE SCARECROW AND DOROTHY HELPED ROLL THE LOGS TOGETHER AND CARRY THE STRIPS OF WOOD BUT IT TOOK SO LONG TO MAKE THE RAFT THAT EVENING CAME JUST AS IT WAS FINISHED AND WITH EVENING THE QUADLING'S WIFE RETURNED FROM HER FISHING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-118 THE WOMAN PROVED TO BE CROSS AND BAD TEMPERED PERHAPS BECAUSE SHE HAD ONLY CAUGHT ONE RED EEL DURING ALL THE DAY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-119 WHEN SHE FOUND THAT HER HUSBAND HAD USED HER CLOTHESLINE AND THE LOGS SHE HAD WANTED FOR FIREWOOD AND THE BOARDS SHE HAD INTENDED TO MEND THE SHED WITH AND A LOT OF GOLD NAILS SHE BECAME VERY ANGRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-120 SCRAPS WANTED TO SHAKE THE WOMAN TO MAKE HER BEHAVE BUT DOROTHY TALKED TO HER IN A GENTLE TONE AND TOLD THE QUADLING'S WIFE SHE WAS A PRINCESS OF OZ AND A FRIEND OF OZMA AND THAT WHEN SHE GOT BACK TO THE EMERALD CITY SHE WOULD SEND THEM A LOT OF THINGS TO REPAY THEM FOR THE RAFT INCLUDING A NEW CLOTHESLINE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-121 THIS PROMISE PLEASED THE WOMAN AND SHE SOON BECAME MORE PLEASANT SAYING THEY COULD STAY THE NIGHT AT HER HOUSE AND BEGIN THEIR VOYAGE ON THE RIVER NEXT MORNING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-122 THIS THEY DID SPENDING A PLEASANT EVENING WITH THE QUADLING FAMILY AND BEING ENTERTAINED WITH SUCH HOSPITALITY AS THE POOR PEOPLE WERE ABLE TO OFFER THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-25-123 THE MAN GROANED A GOOD DEAL AND SAID HE HAD OVERWORKED HIMSELF BY CHOPPING THE LOGS BUT THE SCARECROW GAVE HIM TWO MORE TABLETS THAN HE HAD PROMISED WHICH SEEMED TO COMFORT THE LAZY FELLOW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-01 CHAPTER TWENTY SIX THE TRICK RIVER NEXT MORNING THEY PUSHED THE RAFT INTO THE WATER AND ALL GOT ABOARD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-02 THE QUADLING MAN HAD TO HOLD THE LOG CRAFT FAST WHILE THEY TOOK THEIR PLACES AND THE FLOW OF THE RIVER WAS SO POWERFUL THAT IT NEARLY TORE THE RAFT FROM HIS HANDS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-03 AS SOON AS THEY WERE ALL SEATED UPON THE LOGS HE LET GO AND AWAY IT FLOATED AND THE ADVENTURERS HAD BEGUN THEIR VOYAGE TOWARD THE WINKIE COUNTRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-04 THE LITTLE HOUSE OF THE QUADLINGS WAS OUT OF SIGHT ALMOST BEFORE THEY HAD CRIED THEIR GOOD BYES AND THE SCARECROW SAID IN A PLEASED VOICE, IT WON'T TAKE US LONG TO GET TO THE WINKIE COUNTRY AT THIS RATE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-05 THEY HAD FLOATED SEVERAL MILES DOWN THE STREAM AND WERE ENJOYING THE RIDE WHEN SUDDENLY THE RAFT SLOWED UP STOPPED SHORT AND THEN BEGAN TO FLOAT BACK THE WAY IT HAD COME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-06 WHY WHAT'S WRONG?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-07 ASKED DOROTHY IN ASTONISHMENT,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-08 BUT THEY WERE ALL JUST AS BEWILDERED AS SHE WAS AND AT FIRST NO ONE COULD ANSWER THE QUESTION.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-09 SOON HOWEVER THEY REALIZED THE TRUTH, THAT THE CURRENT OF THE RIVER HAD REVERSED AND THE WATER WAS NOW FLOWING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION TOWARD THE MOUNTAINS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-10 THEY BEGAN TO RECOGNIZE THE SCENES THEY HAD PASSED AND BY AND BY THEY CAME IN SIGHT OF THE LITTLE HOUSE OF THE QUADLINGS AGAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-11 THE MAN WAS STANDING ON THE RIVER BANK AND HE CALLED TO THEM, HOW DO YOU DO?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-12 GLAD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-13 I FORGOT TO TELL YOU THAT THE RIVER CHANGES ITS DIRECTION EVERY LITTLE WHILE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-14 SOMETIMES IT FLOWS ONE WAY AND SOMETIMES THE OTHER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-15 THEY HAD NO TIME TO ANSWER HIM FOR THE RAFT WAS SWEPT PAST THE HOUSE AND A LONG DISTANCE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-16 WE'RE GOING JUST THE WAY WE DON'T WANT TO GO SAID DOROTHY AND I GUESS THE BEST THING WE CAN DO IS TO GET TO LAND BEFORE WE'RE CARRIED ANY FARTHER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-17 BUT THEY COULD NOT GET TO LAND.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-18 THEY HAD NO OARS NOR EVEN A POLE TO GUIDE THE RAFT WITH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-19 THE LOGS WHICH BORE THEM FLOATED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREAM AND WERE HELD FAST IN THAT POSITION BY THE STRONG CURRENT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-20 SO THEY SAT STILL AND WAITED AND EVEN WHILE THEY WERE WONDERING WHAT COULD BE DONE THE RAFT SLOWED DOWN STOPPED AND BEGAN DRIFTING THE OTHER WAY IN THE DIRECTION IT HAD FIRST FOLLOWED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-21 AFTER A TIME THEY REPASSED THE QUADLING HOUSE AND THE MAN WAS STILL STANDING ON THE BANK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-22 HE CRIED OUT TO THEM, GOOD DAY!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-23 GLAD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-24 I EXPECT I SHALL SEE YOU A GOOD MANY TIMES AS YOU GO BY UNLESS YOU HAPPEN TO SWIM ASHORE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-25 BY THAT TIME THEY HAD LEFT HIM BEHIND AND WERE HEADED ONCE MORE STRAIGHT TOWARD THE WINKIE COUNTRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-26 THIS IS PRETTY HARD LUCK SAID OJO IN A DISCOURAGED VOICE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-27 THE TRICK RIVER KEEPS CHANGING IT SEEMS AND HERE WE MUST FLOAT BACK AND FORWARD FOREVER UNLESS WE MANAGE IN SOME WAY TO GET ASHORE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-28 CAN YOU SWIM?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-29 ASKED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-30 NO,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-31 I'M OJO THE UNLUCKY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-32 NEITHER CAN I. TOTO CAN SWIM A LITTLE BUT THAT WON'T HELP US TO GET TO SHORE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-33 I DON'T KNOW WHETHER I COULD SWIM OR NOT REMARKED SCRAPS,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-34 BUT IF I TRIED IT I'D SURELY RUIN MY LOVELY PATCHES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-35 MY STRAW WOULD GET SOGGY IN THE WATER AND I WOULD SINK SAID THE SCARECROW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-36 SO THERE SEEMED NO WAY OUT OF THEIR DILEMMA AND BEING HELPLESS THEY SIMPLY SAT STILL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-37 OJO WHO WAS ON THE FRONT OF THE RAFT LOOKED OVER INTO THE WATER AND THOUGHT HE SAW SOME LARGE FISHES SWIMMING ABOUT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-38 HE FOUND A LOOSE END OF THE CLOTHESLINE WHICH FASTENED THE LOGS TOGETHER AND TAKING A GOLD NAIL FROM HIS POCKET HE BENT IT NEARLY DOUBLE TO FORM A HOOK AND TIED IT TO THE END OF THE LINE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-39 HAVING BAITED THE HOOK WITH SOME BREAD WHICH HE BROKE FROM HIS LOAF HE DROPPED THE LINE INTO THE WATER AND ALMOST INSTANTLY IT WAS SEIZED BY A GREAT FISH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-40 THEY KNEW IT WAS A GREAT FISH BECAUSE IT PULLED SO HARD ON THE LINE THAT IT DRAGGED THE RAFT FORWARD EVEN FASTER THAN THE CURRENT OF THE RIVER HAD CARRIED IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-41 THE FISH WAS FRIGHTENED AND IT WAS A STRONG SWIMMER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-42 AS THE OTHER END OF THE CLOTHESLINE WAS BOUND AROUND THE LOGS HE COULD NOT GET IT AWAY AND AS HE HAD GREEDILY SWALLOWED THE GOLD HOOK AT THE FIRST BITE HE COULD NOT GET RID OF THAT EITHER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-43 WHEN THEY REACHED THE PLACE WHERE THE CURRENT HAD BEFORE CHANGED THE FISH WAS STILL SWIMMING AHEAD IN ITS WILD ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-44 THE RAFT SLOWED DOWN YET IT DID NOT STOP BECAUSE THE FISH WOULD NOT LET IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-45 IT CONTINUED TO MOVE IN THE SAME DIRECTION IT HAD BEEN GOING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-46 AS THE CURRENT REVERSED AND RUSHED BACKWARD ON ITS COURSE IT FAILED TO DRAG THE RAFT WITH IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-47 SLOWLY INCH BY INCH THEY FLOATED ON AND THE FISH TUGGED AND TUGGED AND KEPT THEM GOING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-48 I HOPE HE WON'T GIVE UP SAID OJO ANXIOUSLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-49 IF THE FISH CAN HOLD OUT UNTIL THE CURRENT CHANGES AGAIN WE'LL BE ALL RIGHT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-50 THE FISH DID NOT GIVE UP BUT HELD THE RAFT BRAVELY ON ITS COURSE TILL AT LAST THE WATER IN THE RIVER SHIFTED AGAIN AND FLOATED THEM THE WAY THEY WANTED TO GO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-51 BUT NOW THE CAPTIVE FISH FOUND ITS STRENGTH FAILING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-52 SEEKING A REFUGE IT BEGAN TO DRAG THE RAFT TOWARD THE SHORE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-53 AS THEY DID NOT WISH TO LAND IN THIS PLACE THE BOY CUT THE ROPE WITH HIS POCKET KNIFE AND SET THE FISH FREE JUST IN TIME TO PREVENT THE RAFT FROM GROUNDING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-54 THE NEXT TIME THE RIVER BACKED UP THE SCARECROW MANAGED TO SEIZE THE BRANCH OF A TREE THAT OVERHUNG THE WATER AND THEY ALL ASSISTED HIM TO HOLD FAST AND PREVENT THE RAFT FROM BEING CARRIED BACKWARD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-55 WHILE THEY WAITED HERE OJO SPIED A LONG BROKEN BRANCH LYING UPON THE BANK SO HE LEAPED ASHORE AND GOT IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-56 WHEN HE HAD STRIPPED OFF THE SIDE SHOOTS HE BELIEVED HE COULD USE THE BRANCH AS A POLE TO GUIDE THE RAFT IN CASE OF EMERGENCY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-57 THEY CLUNG TO THE TREE UNTIL THEY FOUND THE WATER FLOWING THE RIGHT WAY WHEN THEY LET GO AND PERMITTED THE RAFT TO RESUME ITS VOYAGE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-58 IN SPITE OF THESE PAUSES THEY WERE REALLY MAKING GOOD PROGRESS TOWARD THE WINKIE COUNTRY AND HAVING FOUND A WAY TO CONQUER THE ADVERSE CURRENT THEIR SPIRITS ROSE CONSIDERABLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-59 THEY COULD SEE LITTLE OF THE COUNTRY THROUGH WHICH THEY WERE PASSING BECAUSE OF THE HIGH BANKS AND THEY MET WITH NO BOATS OR OTHER CRAFT UPON THE SURFACE OF THE RIVER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-60 ONCE MORE THE TRICK RIVER REVERSED ITS CURRENT BUT THIS TIME THE SCARECROW WAS ON GUARD AND USED THE POLE TO PUSH THE RAFT TOWARD A BIG ROCK WHICH LAY IN THE WATER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-61 HE BELIEVED THE ROCK WOULD PREVENT THEIR FLOATING BACKWARD WITH THE CURRENT AND SO IT DID.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-62 THEY CLUNG TO THIS ANCHORAGE UNTIL THE WATER RESUMED ITS PROPER DIRECTION WHEN THEY ALLOWED THE RAFT TO DRIFT ON.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-63 FLOATING AROUND A BEND THEY SAW AHEAD A HIGH BANK OF WATER EXTENDING ACROSS THE ENTIRE RIVER AND TOWARD THIS THEY WERE BEING IRRESISTIBLY CARRIED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-64 THERE BEING NO WAY TO ARREST THE PROGRESS OF THE RAFT THEY CLUNG FAST TO THE LOGS AND LET THE RIVER SWEEP THEM ON.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-65 SWIFTLY THE RAFT CLIMBED THE BANK OF WATER AND SLID DOWN ON THE OTHER SIDE PLUNGING ITS EDGE DEEP INTO THE WATER AND DRENCHING THEM ALL WITH SPRAY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-66 AS AGAIN THE RAFT RIGHTED AND DRIFTED ON DOROTHY AND OJO LAUGHED AT THE DUCKING THEY HAD RECEIVED,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-67 BUT SCRAPS WAS MUCH DISMAYED AND THE SCARECROW TOOK OUT HIS HANDKERCHIEF AND WIPED THE WATER OFF THE PATCHWORK GIRL'S PATCHES AS WELL AS HE WAS ABLE TO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-68 THE SUN SOON DRIED HER AND THE COLORS OF HER PATCHES PROVED GOOD FOR THEY DID NOT RUN TOGETHER NOR DID THEY FADE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-69 AFTER PASSING THE WALL OF WATER THE CURRENT DID NOT CHANGE OR FLOW BACKWARD ANY MORE BUT CONTINUED TO SWEEP THEM STEADILY FORWARD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-70 THE BANKS OF THE RIVER GREW LOWER TOO PERMITTING THEM TO SEE MORE OF THE COUNTRY AND PRESENTLY THEY DISCOVERED YELLOW BUTTERCUPS AND DANDELIONS GROWING AMONGST THE GRASS FROM WHICH EVIDENCE THEY KNEW THEY HAD REACHED THE WINKIE COUNTRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-71 DON'T YOU THINK WE OUGHT TO LAND?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-72 DOROTHY ASKED THE SCARECROW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-73 PRETTY SOON HE REPLIED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-74 THE TIN WOODMAN'S CASTLE IS IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE WINKIE COUNTRY AND SO IT CAN'T BE A GREAT WAY FROM HERE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-75 FEARING THEY MIGHT DRIFT TOO FAR DOROTHY AND OJO NOW STOOD UP AND RAISED THE SCARECROW IN THEIR ARMS AS HIGH AS THEY COULD THUS ALLOWING HIM A GOOD VIEW OF THE COUNTRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-76 FOR A TIME HE SAW NOTHING HE RECOGNIZED BUT FINALLY HE CRIED, THERE IT IS!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-77 THERE IT IS!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-78 WHAT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-79 ASKED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-80 THE TIN WOODMAN'S TIN CASTLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-81 I CAN SEE ITS TURRETS GLITTERING IN THE SUN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-82 IT'S QUITE A WAY OFF BUT WE'D BETTER LAND AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-83 THEY LET HIM DOWN AND BEGAN TO URGE THE RAFT TOWARD THE SHORE BY MEANS OF THE POLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-84 IT OBEYED VERY WELL FOR THE CURRENT WAS MORE SLUGGISH NOW AND SOON THEY HAD REACHED THE BANK AND LANDED SAFELY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-85 THE WINKIE COUNTRY WAS REALLY BEAUTIFUL AND ACROSS THE FIELDS THEY COULD SEE AFAR THE SILVERY SHEEN OF THE TIN CASTLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-86 WITH LIGHT HEARTS THEY HURRIED TOWARD IT BEING FULLY RESTED BY THEIR LONG RIDE ON THE RIVER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-87 BY AND BY THEY BEGAN TO CROSS AN IMMENSE FIELD OF SPLENDID YELLOW LILIES THE DELICATE FRAGRANCE OF WHICH WAS VERY DELIGHTFUL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-88 HOW BEAUTIFUL THEY ARE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-89 CRIED DOROTHY STOPPING TO ADMIRE THE PERFECTION OF THESE EXQUISITE FLOWERS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-90 YES SAID THE SCARECROW REFLECTIVELY BUT WE MUST BE CAREFUL NOT TO CRUSH OR INJURE ANY OF THESE LILIES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-91 WHY NOT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-92 ASKED OJO. THE TIN WOODMAN IS VERY KIND HEARTED WAS THE REPLY AND HE HATES TO SEE ANY LIVING THING HURT IN ANY WAY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-93 ARE FLOWERS ALIVE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-94 ASKED SCRAPS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-95 YES OF COURSE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-96 AND THESE FLOWERS BELONG TO THE TIN WOODMAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-97 SO IN ORDER NOT TO OFFEND HIM WE MUST NOT TREAD ON A SINGLE BLOSSOM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-98 ONCE SAID DOROTHY THE TIN WOODMAN STEPPED ON A BEETLE AND KILLED THE LITTLE CREATURE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-99 THAT MADE HIM VERY UNHAPPY AND HE CRIED UNTIL HIS TEARS RUSTED HIS JOINTS SO HE COULDN'T MOVE EM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-100 WHAT DID HE DO THEN?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-101 ASKED OJO. PUT OIL ON THEM UNTIL THE JOINTS WORKED SMOOTH AGAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-102 OH!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-103 EXCLAIMED THE BOY AS IF A GREAT DISCOVERY HAD FLASHED ACROSS HIS MIND.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-104 BUT HE DID NOT TELL ANYBODY WHAT THE DISCOVERY WAS AND KEPT THE IDEA TO HIMSELF.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-105 IT WAS A LONG WALK BUT A PLEASANT ONE AND THEY DID NOT MIND IT A BIT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-106 LATE IN THE AFTERNOON THEY DREW NEAR TO THE WONDERFUL TIN CASTLE OF THE EMPEROR OF THE WINKIES AND OJO AND SCRAPS WHO HAD NEVER SEEN IT BEFORE WERE FILLED WITH AMAZEMENT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-107 TIN ABOUNDED IN THE WINKIE COUNTRY AND THE WINKIES WERE SAID TO BE THE MOST SKILLFUL TINSMITHS IN ALL THE WORLD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-108 SO THE TIN WOODMAN HAD EMPLOYED THEM IN BUILDING HIS MAGNIFICENT CASTLE WHICH WAS ALL OF TIN FROM THE GROUND TO THE TALLEST TURRET AND SO BRIGHTLY POLISHED THAT IT GLITTERED IN THE SUN'S RAYS MORE GORGEOUSLY THAN SILVER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-109 AROUND THE GROUNDS OF THE CASTLE RAN A TIN WALL WITH TIN GATES,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-110 BUT THE GATES STOOD WIDE OPEN BECAUSE THE EMPEROR HAD NO ENEMIES TO DISTURB HIM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-111 WHEN THEY ENTERED THE SPACIOUS GROUNDS OUR TRAVELERS FOUND MORE TO ADMIRE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-112 TIN FOUNTAINS SENT SPRAYS OF CLEAR WATER FAR INTO THE AIR AND THERE WERE MANY BEDS OF TIN FLOWERS ALL AS PERFECTLY FORMED AS ANY NATURAL FLOWERS MIGHT BE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-113 THERE WERE TIN TREES TOO AND HERE AND THERE SHADY BOWERS OF TIN WITH TIN BENCHES AND CHAIRS TO SIT UPON.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-114 ALSO ON THE SIDES OF THE PATHWAY LEADING UP TO THE FRONT DOOR OF THE CASTLE WERE ROWS OF TIN STATUARY VERY CLEVERLY EXECUTED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-115 AMONG THESE OJO RECOGNIZED STATUES OF DOROTHY TOTO THE SCARECROW THE WIZARD THE SHAGGY MAN JACK PUMPKINHEAD AND OZMA ALL STANDING UPON NEAT PEDESTALS OF TIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-116 TOTO WAS WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE RESIDENCE OF THE TIN WOODMAN AND BEING ASSURED A JOYFUL WELCOME HE RAN AHEAD AND BARKED SO LOUDLY AT THE FRONT DOOR THAT THE TIN WOODMAN HEARD HIM AND CAME OUT IN PERSON TO SEE IF IT WERE REALLY HIS OLD FRIEND TOTO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-117 NEXT MOMENT THE TIN MAN HAD CLASPED THE SCARECROW IN A WARM EMBRACE AND THEN TURNED TO HUG DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-26-118 BUT NOW HIS EYE WAS ARRESTED BY THE STRANGE SIGHT OF THE PATCHWORK GIRL AND HE GAZED UPON HER IN MINGLED WONDER AND ADMIRATION.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-01 CHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN THE TIN WOODMAN OBJECTS THE TIN WOODMAN WAS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PERSONAGES IN ALL OZ. THOUGH EMPEROR OF THE WINKIES HE OWED ALLEGIANCE TO OZMA WHO RULED ALL THE LAND AND THE GIRL AND THE TIN MAN WERE WARM PERSONAL FRIENDS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-02 HE WAS SOMETHING OF A DANDY AND KEPT HIS TIN BODY BRILLIANTLY POLISHED AND HIS TIN JOINTS WELL OILED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-03 ALSO HE WAS VERY COURTEOUS IN MANNER AND SO KIND AND GENTLE THAT EVERYONE LOVED HIM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-04 THE EMPEROR GREETED OJO AND SCRAPS WITH CORDIAL HOSPITALITY AND USHERED THE ENTIRE PARTY INTO HIS HANDSOME TIN PARLOR WHERE ALL THE FURNITURE AND PICTURES WERE MADE OF TIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-05 THE WALLS WERE PANELED WITH TIN AND FROM THE TIN CEILING HUNG TIN CHANDELIERS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-06 THE TIN WOODMAN WANTED TO KNOW FIRST OF ALL WHERE DOROTHY HAD FOUND THE PATCHWORK GIRL SO BETWEEN THEM THE VISITORS TOLD THE STORY OF HOW SCRAPS WAS MADE AS WELL AS THE ACCIDENT TO MARGOLOTTE AND UNC NUNKIE AND HOW OJO HAD SET OUT UPON A JOURNEY TO PROCURE THE THINGS NEEDED FOR THE CROOKED MAGICIAN'S MAGIC CHARM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-07 THEN DOROTHY TOLD OF THEIR ADVENTURES IN THE QUADLING COUNTRY AND HOW AT LAST THEY SUCCEEDED IN GETTING THE WATER FROM A DARK WELL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-08 WHILE THE LITTLE GIRL WAS RELATING THESE ADVENTURES THE TIN WOODMAN SAT IN AN EASY CHAIR LISTENING WITH INTENSE INTEREST WHILE THE OTHERS SAT GROUPED AROUND HIM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-09 OJO HOWEVER HAD KEPT HIS EYES FIXED UPON THE BODY OF THE TIN EMPEROR AND NOW HE NOTICED THAT UNDER THE JOINT OF HIS LEFT KNEE A TINY DROP OF OIL WAS FORMING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-10 HE WATCHED THIS DROP OF OIL WITH A FAST BEATING HEART AND FEELING IN HIS POCKET BROUGHT OUT A TINY VIAL OF CRYSTAL WHICH HE HELD SECRETED IN HIS HAND.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-11 PRESENTLY THE TIN WOODMAN CHANGED HIS POSITION AND AT ONCE OJO TO THE ASTONISHMENT OF ALL DROPPED TO THE FLOOR AND HELD HIS CRYSTAL VIAL UNDER THE EMPEROR'S KNEE JOINT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-12 JUST THEN THE DROP OF OIL FELL AND THE BOY CAUGHT IT IN HIS BOTTLE AND IMMEDIATELY CORKED IT TIGHT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-13 THEN WITH A RED FACE AND EMBARRASSED MANNER HE ROSE TO CONFRONT THE OTHERS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-14 WHAT IN THE WORLD WERE YOU DOING?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-15 ASKED THE TIN WOODMAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-16 I CAUGHT A DROP OF OIL THAT FELL FROM YOUR KNEE JOINT CONFESSED OJO. A DROP OF OIL!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-17 EXCLAIMED THE TIN WOODMAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-18 DEAR ME HOW CARELESS MY VALET MUST HAVE BEEN IN OILING ME THIS MORNING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-19 I'M AFRAID I SHALL HAVE TO SCOLD THE FELLOW FOR I CAN'T BE DROPPING OIL WHEREVER I GO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-20 NEVER MIND SAID DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-21 OJO SEEMS GLAD TO HAVE THE OIL FOR SOME REASON.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-22 YES DECLARED THE MUNCHKIN BOY I AM GLAD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-23 FOR ONE OF THE THINGS THE CROOKED MAGICIAN SENT ME TO GET WAS A DROP OF OIL FROM A LIVE MAN'S BODY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-24 I HAD NO IDEA AT FIRST THAT THERE WAS SUCH A THING,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-25 BUT IT'S NOW SAFE IN THE LITTLE CRYSTAL VIAL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-26 YOU ARE VERY WELCOME TO IT INDEED SAID THE TIN WOODMAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-27 HAVE YOU NOW SECURED ALL THE THINGS YOU WERE IN SEARCH OF?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-28 NOT QUITE ALL ANSWERED OJO. THERE WERE FIVE THINGS I HAD TO GET AND I HAVE FOUND FOUR OF THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-29 I HAVE THE THREE HAIRS IN THE TIP OF A WOOZY'S TAIL A SIX LEAVED CLOVER A GILL OF WATER FROM A DARK WELL AND A DROP OF OIL FROM A LIVE MAN'S BODY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-30 THE LAST THING IS THE EASIEST OF ALL TO GET AND I'M SURE THAT MY DEAR UNC NUNKIE AND GOOD MARGOLOTTE AS WELL WILL SOON BE RESTORED TO LIFE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-31 THE MUNCHKIN BOY SAID THIS WITH MUCH PRIDE AND PLEASURE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-32 GOOD!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-33 EXCLAIMED THE TIN WOODMAN,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-34 I CONGRATULATE YOU.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-35 BUT WHAT IS THE FIFTH AND LAST THING YOU NEED IN ORDER TO COMPLETE THE MAGIC CHARM?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-36 THE LEFT WING OF A YELLOW BUTTERFLY SAID OJO. IN THIS YELLOW COUNTRY AND WITH YOUR KIND ASSISTANCE THAT OUGHT TO BE VERY EASY TO FIND.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-37 THE TIN WOODMAN STARED AT HIM IN AMAZEMENT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-38 SURELY YOU ARE JOKING!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-39 HE SAID.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-40 NO REPLIED OJO MUCH SURPRISED,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-41 I AM IN EARNEST.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-42 BUT DO YOU THINK FOR A MOMENT THAT I WOULD PERMIT YOU OR ANYONE ELSE TO PULL THE LEFT WING FROM A YELLOW BUTTERFLY?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-43 DEMANDED THE TIN WOODMAN STERNLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-44 WHY NOT SIR?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-45 WHY NOT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-46 YOU ASK ME WHY NOT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-47 IT WOULD BE CRUEL ONE OF THE MOST CRUEL AND HEARTLESS DEEDS I EVER HEARD OF ASSERTED THE TIN WOODMAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-48 THE BUTTERFLIES ARE AMONG THE PRETTIEST OF ALL CREATED THINGS AND THEY ARE VERY SENSITIVE TO PAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-49 TO TEAR A WING FROM ONE WOULD CAUSE IT EXQUISITE TORTURE AND IT WOULD SOON DIE IN GREAT AGONY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-50 I WOULD NOT PERMIT SUCH A WICKED DEED UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-51 OJO WAS ASTOUNDED AT HEARING THIS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-52 DOROTHY TOO LOOKED GRAVE AND DISCONCERTED BUT SHE KNEW IN HER HEART THAT THE TIN WOODMAN WAS RIGHT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-53 THE SCARECROW NODDED HIS HEAD IN APPROVAL OF HIS FRIEND'S SPEECH SO IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE AGREED WITH THE EMPEROR'S DECISION.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-54 SCRAPS LOOKED FROM ONE TO ANOTHER IN PERPLEXITY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-55 WHO CARES FOR A BUTTERFLY?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-56 SHE ASKED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-57 DON'T YOU?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-58 INQUIRED THE TIN WOODMAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-59 NOT THE SNAP OF A FINGER FOR I HAVE NO HEART SAID THE PATCHWORK GIRL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-60 BUT I WANT TO HELP OJO WHO IS MY FRIEND TO RESCUE THE UNCLE WHOM HE LOVES AND I'D KILL A DOZEN USELESS BUTTERFLIES TO ENABLE HIM TO DO THAT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-61 THE TIN WOODMAN SIGHED REGRETFULLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-62 YOU HAVE KIND INSTINCTS HE SAID AND WITH A HEART YOU WOULD INDEED BE A FINE CREATURE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-63 I CANNOT BLAME YOU FOR YOUR HEARTLESS REMARK AS YOU CANNOT UNDERSTAND THE FEELINGS OF THOSE WHO POSSESS HEARTS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-64 I FOR INSTANCE HAVE A VERY NEAT AND RESPONSIVE HEART WHICH THE WONDERFUL WIZARD OF OZ ONCE GAVE ME AND SO I SHALL NEVER NEVER NEVER PERMIT A POOR YELLOW BUTTERFLY TO BE TORTURED BY ANYONE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-65 THE YELLOW COUNTRY OF THE WINKIES SAID OJO SADLY IS THE ONLY PLACE IN OZ WHERE A YELLOW BUTTERFLY CAN BE FOUND.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-66 I'M GLAD OF THAT SAID THE TIN WOODMAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-67 AS I RULE THE WINKIE COUNTRY I CAN PROTECT MY BUTTERFLIES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-68 THEN HE MUST REMAIN A MARBLE STATUE FOREVER DECLARED THE TIN EMPEROR FIRMLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-69 OJO WIPED HIS EYES FOR HE COULD NOT HOLD BACK THE TEARS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-70 I'LL TELL YOU WHAT TO DO SAID SCRAPS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-71 WE'LL TAKE A WHOLE YELLOW BUTTERFLY ALIVE AND WELL TO THE CROOKED MAGICIAN AND LET HIM PULL THE LEFT WING OFF.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-72 NO YOU WON'T SAID THE TIN WOODMAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-73 YOU CAN'T HAVE ONE OF MY DEAR LITTLE BUTTERFLIES TO TREAT IN THAT WAY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-74 THEN WHAT IN THE WORLD SHALL WE DO?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-75 ASKED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-76 THEY ALL BECAME SILENT AND THOUGHTFUL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-77 NO ONE SPOKE FOR A LONG TIME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-78 THEN THE TIN WOODMAN SUDDENLY ROUSED HIMSELF AND SAID, WE MUST ALL GO BACK TO THE EMERALD CITY AND ASK OZMA'S ADVICE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-79 SHE'S A WISE LITTLE GIRL OUR RULER AND SHE MAY FIND A WAY TO HELP OJO SAVE HIS UNC NUNKIE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-80 SO THE FOLLOWING MORNING THE PARTY STARTED ON THE JOURNEY TO THE EMERALD CITY WHICH THEY REACHED IN DUE TIME WITHOUT ANY IMPORTANT ADVENTURE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-81 IT WAS A SAD JOURNEY FOR OJO FOR WITHOUT THE WING OF THE YELLOW BUTTERFLY HE SAW NO WAY TO SAVE UNC NUNKIE UNLESS HE WAITED SIX YEARS FOR THE CROOKED MAGICIAN TO MAKE A NEW LOT OF THE POWDER OF LIFE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-82 THE BOY WAS UTTERLY DISCOURAGED AND AS HE WALKED ALONG HE GROANED ALOUD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-83 IS ANYTHING HURTING YOU?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-84 INQUIRED THE TIN WOODMAN IN A KINDLY TONE FOR THE EMPEROR WAS WITH THE PARTY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-85 I'M OJO THE UNLUCKY REPLIED THE BOY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-86 I MIGHT HAVE KNOWN I WOULD FAIL IN ANYTHING I TRIED TO DO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-87 WHY ARE YOU OJO THE UNLUCKY?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-88 ASKED THE TIN MAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-89 BECAUSE I WAS BORN ON A FRIDAY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-90 FRIDAY IS NOT UNLUCKY DECLARED THE EMPEROR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-91 IT'S JUST ONE OF SEVEN DAYS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-92 DO YOU SUPPOSE ALL THE WORLD BECOMES UNLUCKY ONE SEVENTH OF THE TIME?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-93 IT WAS THE THIRTEENTH DAY OF THE MONTH SAID OJO. THIRTEEN!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-94 AH THAT IS INDEED A LUCKY NUMBER REPLIED THE TIN WOODMAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-95 ALL MY GOOD LUCK SEEMS TO HAPPEN ON THE THIRTEENTH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-96 I SUPPOSE MOST PEOPLE NEVER NOTICE THE GOOD LUCK THAT COMES TO THEM WITH THE NUMBER THIRTEEN AND YET IF THE LEAST BIT OF BAD LUCK FALLS ON THAT DAY THEY BLAME IT TO THE NUMBER AND NOT TO THE PROPER CAUSE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-97 THIRTEEN'S MY LUCKY NUMBER TOO REMARKED THE SCARECROW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-98 AND MINE SAID SCRAPS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-99 I'VE JUST THIRTEEN PATCHES ON MY HEAD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-100 BUT CONTINUED OJO I'M LEFT HANDED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-101 MANY OF OUR GREATEST MEN ARE THAT WAY ASSERTED THE EMPEROR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-102 TO BE LEFT HANDED IS USUALLY TO BE TWO HANDED,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-103 THE RIGHT HANDED PEOPLE ARE USUALLY ONE HANDED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-104 AND I'VE A WART UNDER MY RIGHT ARM SAID OJO. HOW LUCKY!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-105 CRIED THE TIN WOODMAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-106 IF IT WERE ON THE END OF YOUR NOSE IT MIGHT BE UNLUCKY BUT UNDER YOUR ARM IT IS LUCKILY OUT OF THE WAY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-107 FOR ALL THOSE REASONS SAID THE MUNCHKIN BOY I HAVE BEEN CALLED OJO THE UNLUCKY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-108 THEN WE MUST TURN OVER A NEW LEAF AND CALL YOU HENCEFORTH OJO THE LUCKY DECLARED THE TIN MAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-109 EVERY REASON YOU HAVE GIVEN IS ABSURD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-110 BUT I HAVE NOTICED THAT THOSE WHO CONTINUALLY DREAD ILL LUCK AND FEAR IT WILL OVERTAKE THEM HAVE NO TIME TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ANY GOOD FORTUNE THAT COMES THEIR WAY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-111 MAKE UP YOUR MIND TO BE OJO THE LUCKY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-112 HOW CAN I?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-113 ASKED THE BOY WHEN ALL MY ATTEMPTS TO SAVE MY DEAR UNCLE HAVE FAILED?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-114 NEVER GIVE UP OJO ADVISED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-115 NO ONE EVER KNOWS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-116 OJO DID NOT REPLY BUT HE WAS SO DEJECTED THAT EVEN THEIR ARRIVAL AT THE EMERALD CITY FAILED TO INTEREST HIM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-117 THE PEOPLE JOYFULLY CHEERED THE APPEARANCE OF THE TIN WOODMAN THE SCARECROW AND DOROTHY WHO WERE ALL THREE GENERAL FAVORITES AND ON ENTERING THE ROYAL PALACE WORD CAME TO THEM FROM OZMA THAT SHE WOULD AT ONCE GRANT THEM AN AUDIENCE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-118 DOROTHY TOLD THE GIRL RULER HOW SUCCESSFUL THEY HAD BEEN IN THEIR QUEST UNTIL THEY CAME TO THE ITEM OF THE YELLOW BUTTERFLY WHICH THE TIN WOODMAN POSITIVELY REFUSED TO SACRIFICE TO THE MAGIC POTION.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-119 HE IS QUITE RIGHT SAID OZMA WHO DID NOT SEEM A BIT SURPRISED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-120 HAD OJO TOLD ME THAT ONE OF THE THINGS HE SOUGHT WAS THE WING OF A YELLOW BUTTERFLY I WOULD HAVE INFORMED HIM BEFORE HE STARTED OUT THAT HE COULD NEVER SECURE IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-121 THEN YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN SAVED THE TROUBLES AND ANNOYANCES OF YOUR LONG JOURNEY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-122 I DIDN'T MIND THE JOURNEY AT ALL SAID DOROTHY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-123 IT WAS FUN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-124 AS IT HAS TURNED OUT REMARKED OJO I CAN NEVER GET THE THINGS THE CROOKED MAGICIAN SENT ME FOR,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-125 AND SO UNLESS I WAIT THE SIX YEARS FOR HIM TO MAKE THE POWDER OF LIFE UNC NUNKIE CANNOT BE SAVED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-126 OZMA SMILED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-127 I HAVE SENT FOR HIM AND HAD HIM BROUGHT TO THIS PALACE WHERE HE NOW IS AND HIS FOUR KETTLES HAVE BEEN DESTROYED AND HIS BOOK OF RECIPES BURNED UP.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-128 I HAVE ALSO HAD BROUGHT HERE THE MARBLE STATUES OF YOUR UNCLE AND OF MARGOLOTTE WHICH ARE STANDING IN THE NEXT ROOM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-129 THEY WERE ALL GREATLY ASTONISHED AT THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-130 OH LET ME SEE UNC NUNKIE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-131 LET ME SEE HIM AT ONCE PLEASE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-132 CRIED OJO EAGERLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-133 WAIT A MOMENT REPLIED OZMA FOR I HAVE SOMETHING MORE TO SAY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-134 NOTHING THAT HAPPENS IN THE LAND OF OZ ESCAPES THE NOTICE OF OUR WISE SORCERESS GLINDA THE GOOD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-135 SHE KNEW ALL ABOUT THE MAGIC MAKING OF DOCTOR PIPT AND HOW HE HAD BROUGHT THE GLASS CAT AND THE PATCHWORK GIRL TO LIFE AND THE ACCIDENT TO UNC NUNKIE AND MARGOLOTTE AND OF OJO'S QUEST AND HIS JOURNEY WITH DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-136 GLINDA ALSO KNEW THAT OJO WOULD FAIL TO FIND ALL THE THINGS HE SOUGHT SO SHE SENT FOR OUR WIZARD AND INSTRUCTED HIM WHAT TO DO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-137 SOMETHING IS GOING TO HAPPEN IN THIS PALACE PRESENTLY AND THAT SOMETHING WILL I AM SURE PLEASE YOU ALL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-27-138 AND NOW CONTINUED THE GIRL RULER RISING FROM HER CHAIR YOU MAY FOLLOW ME INTO THE NEXT ROOM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-28-01 CHAPTER TWENTY EIGHT THE WONDERFUL WIZARD OF OZ WHEN OJO ENTERED THE ROOM HE RAN QUICKLY TO THE STATUE OF UNC NUNKIE AND KISSED THE MARBLE FACE AFFECTIONATELY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-28-02 I DID MY BEST UNC HE SAID WITH A SOB BUT IT WAS NO USE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-28-03 THEN HE DREW BACK AND LOOKED AROUND THE ROOM AND THE SIGHT OF THE ASSEMBLED COMPANY QUITE AMAZED HIM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-28-04 ASIDE FROM THE MARBLE STATUES OF UNC NUNKIE AND MARGOLOTTE THE GLASS CAT WAS THERE CURLED UP ON A RUG,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-28-05 AND THE WOOZY WAS THERE SITTING ON ITS SQUARE HIND LEGS AND LOOKING ON THE SCENE WITH SOLEMN INTEREST,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-28-06 AND THERE WAS THE SHAGGY MAN IN A SUIT OF SHAGGY PEA GREEN SATIN AND AT A TABLE SAT THE LITTLE WIZARD LOOKING QUITE IMPORTANT AND AS IF HE KNEW MUCH MORE THAN HE CARED TO TELL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-28-07 LAST OF ALL DOCTOR PIPT WAS THERE AND THE CROOKED MAGICIAN SAT HUMPED UP IN A CHAIR SEEMING VERY DEJECTED BUT KEEPING HIS EYES FIXED ON THE LIFELESS FORM OF HIS WIFE MARGOLOTTE WHOM HE FONDLY LOVED BUT WHOM HE NOW FEARED WAS LOST TO HIM FOREVER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-28-08 OZMA TOOK A CHAIR WHICH JELLIA JAMB WHEELED FORWARD FOR THE RULER AND BACK OF HER STOOD THE SCARECROW THE TIN WOODMAN AND DOROTHY AS WELL AS THE COWARDLY LION AND THE HUNGRY TIGER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-28-09 THE WIZARD NOW AROSE AND MADE A LOW BOW TO OZMA AND ANOTHER LESS DEFERENT BOW TO THE ASSEMBLED COMPANY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-28-10 LADIES AND GENTLEMEN AND BEASTS HE SAID I BEG TO ANNOUNCE THAT OUR GRACIOUS RULER HAS PERMITTED ME TO OBEY THE COMMANDS OF THE GREAT SORCERESS GLINDA THE GOOD WHOSE HUMBLE ASSISTANT I AM PROUD TO BE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-28-11 WE HAVE DISCOVERED THAT THE CROOKED MAGICIAN HAS BEEN INDULGING IN HIS MAGICAL ARTS CONTRARY TO LAW AND THEREFORE BY ROYAL EDICT I HEREBY DEPRIVE HIM OF ALL POWER TO WORK MAGIC IN THE FUTURE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-28-12 HE IS NO LONGER A CROOKED MAGICIAN BUT A SIMPLE MUNCHKIN,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-28-13 HE IS NO LONGER EVEN CROOKED BUT A MAN LIKE OTHER MEN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-28-14 AS HE PRONOUNCED THESE WORDS THE WIZARD WAVED HIS HAND TOWARD DOCTOR PIPT AND INSTANTLY EVERY CROOKED LIMB STRAIGHTENED OUT AND BECAME PERFECT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-28-15 THE FORMER MAGICIAN WITH A CRY OF JOY SPRANG TO HIS FEET LOOKED AT HIMSELF IN WONDER AND THEN FELL BACK IN HIS CHAIR AND WATCHED THE WIZARD WITH FASCINATED INTEREST.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-28-16 THE GLASS CAT WHICH DOCTOR PIPT LAWLESSLY MADE CONTINUED THE WIZARD IS A PRETTY CAT BUT ITS PINK BRAINS MADE IT SO CONCEITED THAT IT WAS A DISAGREEABLE COMPANION TO EVERYONE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-28-17 SO THE OTHER DAY I TOOK AWAY THE PINK BRAINS AND REPLACED THEM WITH TRANSPARENT ONES AND NOW THE GLASS CAT IS SO MODEST AND WELL BEHAVED THAT OZMA HAS DECIDED TO KEEP HER IN THE PALACE AS A PET.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-28-18 I THANK YOU SAID THE CAT IN A SOFT VOICE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-28-19 THE WOOZY HAS PROVED HIMSELF A GOOD WOOZY AND A FAITHFUL FRIEND THE WIZARD WENT ON SO WE WILL SEND HIM TO THE ROYAL MENAGERIE WHERE HE WILL HAVE GOOD CARE AND PLENTY TO EAT ALL HIS LIFE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-28-20 MUCH OBLIGED SAID THE WOOZY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-28-21 THAT BEATS BEING FENCED UP IN A LONELY FOREST AND STARVED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-28-22 AS FOR THE PATCHWORK GIRL RESUMED THE WIZARD SHE IS SO REMARKABLE IN APPEARANCE AND SO CLEVER AND GOOD TEMPERED THAT OUR GRACIOUS RULER INTENDS TO PRESERVE HER CAREFULLY AS ONE OF THE CURIOSITIES OF THE CURIOUS LAND OF OZ. SCRAPS MAY LIVE IN THE PALACE OR WHEREVER SHE PLEASES AND BE NOBODY'S SERVANT BUT HER OWN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-28-23 THAT'S ALL RIGHT SAID SCRAPS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-28-24 WE HAVE ALL BEEN INTERESTED IN OJO THE LITTLE WIZARD CONTINUED BECAUSE HIS LOVE FOR HIS UNFORTUNATE UNCLE HAS LED HIM BRAVELY TO FACE ALL SORTS OF DANGERS IN ORDER THAT HE MIGHT RESCUE HIM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-28-25 THE MUNCHKIN BOY HAS A LOYAL AND GENEROUS HEART AND HAS DONE HIS BEST TO RESTORE UNC NUNKIE TO LIFE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-28-26 HE HAS FAILED BUT THERE ARE OTHERS MORE POWERFUL THAN THE CROOKED MAGICIAN AND THERE ARE MORE WAYS THAN DOCTOR PIPT KNEW OF TO DESTROY THE CHARM OF THE LIQUID OF PETRIFACTION.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-28-27 GLINDA THE GOOD HAS TOLD ME OF ONE WAY AND YOU SHALL NOW LEARN HOW GREAT IS THE KNOWLEDGE AND POWER OF OUR PEERLESS SORCERESS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-28-28 AS HE SAID THIS THE WIZARD ADVANCED TO THE STATUE OF MARGOLOTE AND MADE A MAGIC PASS AT THE SAME TIME MUTTERING A MAGIC WORD THAT NONE COULD HEAR DISTINCTLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-28-29 AT ONCE THE WOMAN MOVED TURNED HER HEAD WONDERINGLY THIS WAY AND THAT TO NOTE ALL WHO STOOD BEFORE HER AND SEEING DOCTOR PIPT RAN FORWARD AND THREW HERSELF INTO HER HUSBAND'S OUTSTRETCHED ARMS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-28-30 THEN THE WIZARD MADE THE MAGIC PASS AND SPOKE THE MAGIC WORD BEFORE THE STATUE OF UNC NUNKIE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-28-31 THE OLD MUNCHKIN IMMEDIATELY CAME TO LIFE AND WITH A LOW BOW TO THE WIZARD SAID, THANKS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-28-32 BUT NOW OJO RUSHED UP AND THREW HIS ARMS JOYFULLY ABOUT HIS UNCLE AND THE OLD MAN HUGGED HIS LITTLE NEPHEW TENDERLY AND STROKED HIS HAIR AND WIPED AWAY THE BOY'S TEARS WITH A HANDKERCHIEF FOR OJO WAS CRYING FROM PURE HAPPINESS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-28-33 OZMA CAME FORWARD TO CONGRATULATE THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-28-34 I HAVE GIVEN TO YOU MY DEAR OJO AND UNC NUNKIE A NICE HOUSE JUST OUTSIDE THE WALLS OF THE EMERALD CITY SHE SAID AND THERE YOU SHALL MAKE YOUR FUTURE HOME AND BE UNDER MY PROTECTION.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-28-35 DIDN'T I SAY YOU WERE OJO THE LUCKY?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-28-36 ASKED THE TIN WOODMAN AS EVERYONE CROWDED AROUND TO SHAKE OJO'S HAND.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-28-37 YES,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-28-38 AND IT IS TRUE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ2-28-39 REPLIED OJO GRATEFULLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-01-01 AUTHOR'S NOTE PERHAPS I SHOULD ADMIT ON THE TITLE PAGE THAT THIS BOOK IS BY L. FRANK BAUM AND HIS CORRESPONDENTS FOR I HAVE USED MANY SUGGESTIONS CONVEYED TO ME IN LETTERS FROM CHILDREN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-01-02 ONCE ON A TIME I REALLY IMAGINED MYSELF AN AUTHOR OF FAIRY TALES BUT NOW I AM MERELY AN EDITOR OR PRIVATE SECRETARY FOR A HOST OF YOUNGSTERS WHOSE IDEAS I AM REQUESTSED TO WEAVE INTO THE THREAD OF MY STORIES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-01-03 THESE IDEAS ARE OFTEN CLEVER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-01-04 THEY ARE ALSO LOGICAL AND INTERESTING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-01-05 SO I HAVE USED THEM WHENEVER I COULD FIND AN OPPORTUNITY AND IT IS BUT JUST THAT I ACKNOWLEDGE MY INDEBTEDNESS TO MY LITTLE FRIENDS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-01-06 MY WHAT IMAGINATIONS THESE CHILDREN HAVE DEVELOPED!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-01-07 SOMETIMES I AM FAIRLY ASTOUNDED BY THEIR DARING AND GENIUS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-01-08 THERE WILL BE NO LACK OF FAIRY TALE AUTHORS IN THE FUTURE I AM SURE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-01-09 MY READERS HAVE TOLD ME WHAT TO DO WITH DOROTHY AND AUNT EM AND UNCLE HENRY AND I HAVE OBEYED THEIR MANDATES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-01-10 THEY HAVE ALSO GIVEN ME A VARIETY OF SUBJECTS TO WRITE ABOUT IN THE FUTURE, ENOUGH IN FACT TO KEEP ME BUSY FOR SOME TIME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-01-11 I AM VERY PROUD OF THIS ALLIANCE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-01-12 CHILDREN LOVE THESE STORIES BECAUSE CHILDREN HAVE HELPED TO CREATE THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-01-13 MY READERS KNOW WHAT THEY WANT AND REALIZE THAT I TRY TO PLEASE THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-01-14 THE RESULT IS VERY SATISFACTORY TO THE PUBLISHERS TO ME AND I AM QUITE SURE TO THE CHILDREN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-01-15 I HOPE MY DEARS IT WILL BE A LONG TIME BEFORE WE ARE OBLIGED TO DISSOLVE PARTNERSHIP.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-01-16 L. FRANK BAUM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-01-17 BLUG!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-01-18 MAJESTY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-01-19 NOMES ARE GOOD FIGHTERS BUT THEY ARE NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO CONQUER THE EMERALD CITY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-01-20 HIM FLAT UPON THE GROUND WHERE HE LAY MOTIONLESS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-01-21 THIS NOME KING WAS NAMED ROQUAT THE RED AND NO ONE LOVED HIM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-01 CHAPTER TWO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-02 HOW UNCLE HENRY GOT INTO TROUBLE DOROTHY GALE LIVED ON A FARM IN KANSAS WITH HER AUNT EM AND HER UNCLE HENRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-03 IT WAS NOT A BIG FARM NOR A VERY GOOD ONE BECAUSE SOMETIMES THE RAIN DID NOT COME WHEN THE CROPS NEEDED IT AND THEN EVERYTHING WITHERED AND DRIED UP.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-04 ONCE A CYCLONE HAD CARRIED AWAY UNCLE HENRY'S HOUSE SO THAT HE WAS OBLIGED TO BUILD ANOTHER,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-05 AND AS HE WAS A POOR MAN HE HAD TO MORTGAGE HIS FARM TO GET THE MONEY TO PAY FOR THE NEW HOUSE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-06 THEN HIS HEALTH BECAME BAD AND HE WAS TOO FEEBLE TO WORK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-07 THE DOCTOR ORDERED HIM TO TAKE A SEA VOYAGE AND HE WENT TO AUSTRALIA AND TOOK DOROTHY WITH HIM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-08 THAT COST A LOT OF MONEY TOO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-09 UNCLE HENRY GREW POORER EVERY YEAR AND THE CROPS RAISED ON THE FARM ONLY BOUGHT FOOD FOR THE FAMILY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-10 THEREFORE THE MORTGAGE COULD NOT BE PAID.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-11 AT LAST THE BANKER WHO HAD LOANED HIM THE MONEY SAID THAT IF HE DID NOT PAY ON A CERTAIN DAY HIS FARM WOULD BE TAKEN AWAY FROM HIM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-12 THIS WORRIED UNCLE HENRY A GOOD DEAL FOR WITHOUT THE FARM HE WOULD HAVE NO WAY TO EARN A LIVING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-13 HE WAS A GOOD MAN AND WORKED IN THE FIELD AS HARD AS HE COULD,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-14 AND AUNT EM DID ALL THE HOUSEWORK WITH DOROTHY'S HELP.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-15 YET THEY DID NOT SEEM TO GET ALONG.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-16 THIS LITTLE GIRL DOROTHY WAS LIKE DOZENS OF LITTLE GIRLS YOU KNOW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-17 SHE WAS LOVING AND USUALLY SWEET TEMPERED AND HAD A ROUND ROSY FACE AND EARNEST EYES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-18 LIFE WAS A SERIOUS THING TO DOROTHY AND A WONDERFUL THING TOO FOR SHE HAD ENCOUNTERED MORE STRANGE ADVENTURES IN HER SHORT LIFE THAN MANY OTHER GIRLS OF HER AGE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-19 AUNT EM ONCE SAID SHE THOUGHT THE FAIRIES MUST HAVE MARKED DOROTHY AT HER BIRTH BECAUSE SHE HAD WANDERED INTO STRANGE PLACES AND HAD ALWAYS BEEN PROTECTED BY SOME UNSEEN POWER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-20 AS FOR UNCLE HENRY HE THOUGHT HIS LITTLE NIECE MERELY A DREAMER AS HER DEAD MOTHER HAD BEEN FOR HE COULD NOT QUITE BELIEVE ALL THE CURIOUS STORIES DOROTHY TOLD THEM OF THE LAND OF OZ WHICH SHE HAD SEVERAL TIMES VISITED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-21 HE DID NOT THINK THAT SHE TRIED TO DECEIVE HER UNCLE AND AUNT BUT HE IMAGINED THAT SHE HAD DREAMED ALL OF THOSE ASTONISHING ADVENTURES AND THAT THE DREAMS HAD BEEN SO REAL TO HER THAT SHE HAD COME TO BELIEVE THEM TRUE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-22 WHATEVER THE EXPLANATION MIGHT BE IT WAS CERTAIN THAT DOROTHY HAD BEEN ABSENT FROM HER KANSAS HOME FOR SEVERAL LONG PERIODS ALWAYS DISAPPEARING UNEXPECTEDLY YET ALWAYS COMING BACK SAFE AND SOUND WITH AMAZING TALES OF WHERE SHE HAD BEEN AND THE UNUSUAL PEOPLE SHE HAD MET.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-23 HER UNCLE AND AUNT LISTENED TO HER STORIES EAGERLY AND IN SPITE OF THEIR DOUBTS BEGAN TO FEEL THAT THE LITTLE GIRL HAD GAINED A LOT OF EXPERIENCE AND WISDOM THAT WERE UNACCOUNTABLE IN THIS AGE WHEN FAIRIES ARE SUPPOSED NO LONGER TO EXIST.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-24 MOST OF DOROTHY'S STORIES WERE ABOUT THE LAND OF OZ WITH ITS BEAUTIFUL EMERALD CITY AND A LOVELY GIRL RULER NAMED OZMA WHO WAS THE MOST FAITHFUL FRIEND OF THE LITTLE KANSAS GIRL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-25 WHEN DOROTHY TOLD ABOUT THE RICHES OF THIS FAIRY COUNTRY UNCLE HENRY WOULD SIGH FOR HE KNEW THAT A SINGLE ONE OF THE GREAT EMERALDS THAT WERE SO COMMON THERE WOULD PAY ALL HIS DEBTS AND LEAVE HIS FARM FREE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-26 BUT DOROTHY NEVER BROUGHT ANY JEWELS HOME WITH HER SO THEIR POVERTY BECAME GREATER EVERY YEAR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-27 WHEN THE BANKER TOLD UNCLE HENRY THAT HE MUST PAY THE MONEY IN THIRTY DAYS OR LEAVE THE FARM THE POOR MAN WAS IN DESPAIR AS HE KNEW HE COULD NOT POSSIBLY GET THE MONEY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-28 SO HE TOLD HIS WIFE AUNT EM OF HIS TROUBLE AND SHE FIRST CRIED A LITTLE AND THEN SAID THAT THEY MUST BE BRAVE AND DO THE BEST THEY COULD AND GO AWAY SOMEWHERE AND TRY TO EARN AN HONEST LIVING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-29 BUT THEY WERE GETTING OLD AND FEEBLE AND SHE FEARED THAT THEY COULD NOT TAKE CARE OF DOROTHY AS WELL AS THEY HAD FORMERLY DONE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-30 PROBABLY THE LITTLE GIRL WOULD ALSO BE OBLIGED TO GO TO WORK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-31 THEY DID NOT TELL THEIR NIECE THE SAD NEWS FOR SEVERAL DAYS NOT WISHING TO MAKE HER UNHAPPY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-32 BUT ONE MORNING THE LITTLE GIRL FOUND AUNT EM SOFTLY CRYING WHILE UNCLE HENRY TRIED TO COMFORT HER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-33 THEN DOROTHY ASKED THEM TO TELL HER WHAT WAS THE MATTER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-34 WE MUST GIVE UP THE FARM MY DEAR REPLIED HER UNCLE SADLY AND WANDER AWAY INTO THE WORLD TO WORK FOR OUR LIVING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-35 THE GIRL LISTENED QUITE SERIOUSLY FOR SHE HAD NOT KNOWN BEFORE HOW DESPERATELY POOR THEY WERE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-36 WE DON'T MIND FOR OURSELVES SAID HER AUNT STROKING THE LITTLE GIRL'S HEAD TENDERLY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-37 BUT WE LOVE YOU AS IF YOU WERE OUR OWN CHILD AND WE ARE HEART BROKEN TO THINK THAT YOU MUST ALSO ENDURE POVERTY AND WORK FOR A LIVING BEFORE YOU HAVE GROWN BIG AND STRONG.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-38 WHAT COULD I DO TO EARN MONEY?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-39 ASKED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-40 YOU MIGHT DO HOUSEWORK FOR SOME ONE DEAR YOU ARE SO HANDY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-41 OR PERHAPS YOU COULD BE A NURSE MAID TO LITTLE CHILDREN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-42 I'M SURE I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU CAN DO TO EARN MONEY BUT IF YOUR UNCLE AND I ARE ABLE TO SUPPORT YOU WE WILL DO IT WILLINGLY AND SEND YOU TO SCHOOL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-43 WE FEAR THOUGH THAT WE SHALL HAVE MUCH TROUBLE IN EARNING A LIVING FOR OURSELVES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-44 NO ONE WANTS TO EMPLOY OLD PEOPLE WHO ARE BROKEN DOWN IN HEALTH AS WE ARE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-45 DOROTHY SMILED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-46 WOULDN'T IT BE FUNNY SHE SAID FOR ME TO DO HOUSEWORK IN KANSAS WHEN I'M A PRINCESS IN THE LAND OF OZ?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-47 A PRINCESS!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-48 THEY BOTH EXCLAIMED ASTONISHED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-49 YES,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-50 OZMA MADE ME A PRINCESS SOME TIME AGO AND SHE HAS OFTEN BEGGED ME TO COME AND LIVE ALWAYS IN THE EMERALD CITY SAID THE CHILD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-51 HER UNCLE AND AUNT LOOKED AT HER IN AMAZEMENT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-52 THEN THE MAN SAID, DO YOU SUPPOSE YOU COULD MANAGE TO RETURN TO YOUR FAIRYLAND MY DEAR?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-53 OH YES REPLIED DOROTHY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-54 I COULD DO THAT EASILY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-55 HOW?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-56 ASKED AUNT EM. OZMA SEES ME EVERY DAY AT FOUR O'CLOCK IN HER MAGIC PICTURE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-57 SHE CAN SEE ME WHEREVER I AM NO MATTER WHAT I AM DOING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-58 AND AT THAT TIME IF I MAKE A CERTAIN SECRET SIGN SHE WILL SEND FOR ME BY MEANS OF THE MAGIC BELT WHICH I ONCE CAPTURED FROM THE NOME KING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-59 THEN IN THE WINK OF AN EYE I SHALL BE WITH OZMA IN HER PALACE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-60 THE ELDER PEOPLE REMAINED SILENT FOR SOME TIME AFTER DOROTHY HAD SPOKEN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-61 FINALLY AUNT EM SAID WITH ANOTHER SIGH OF REGRET, IF THAT IS THE CASE DOROTHY PERHAPS YOU'D BETTER GO AND LIVE IN THE EMERALD CITY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-62 IT WILL BREAK OUR HEARTS TO LOSE YOU FROM OUR LIVES BUT YOU WILL BE SO MUCH BETTER OFF WITH YOUR FAIRY FRIENDS THAT IT SEEMS WISEST AND BEST FOR YOU TO GO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-63 I'M NOT SO SURE ABOUT THAT REMARKED UNCLE HENRY SHAKING HIS GRAY HEAD DOUBTFULLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-64 THESE THINGS ALL SEEM REAL TO DOROTHY I KNOW,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-65 BUT I'M AFRAID OUR LITTLE GIRL WON'T FIND HER FAIRYLAND JUST WHAT SHE HAD DREAMED IT TO BE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-66 IT WOULD MAKE ME VERY UNHAPPY TO THINK THAT SHE WAS WANDERING AMONG STRANGERS WHO MIGHT BE UNKIND TO HER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-67 DOROTHY LAUGHED MERRILY AT THIS SPEECH AND THEN SHE BECAME VERY SOBER AGAIN FOR SHE COULD SEE HOW ALL THIS TROUBLE WAS WORRYING HER AUNT AND UNCLE AND KNEW THAT UNLESS SHE FOUND A WAY TO HELP THEM THEIR FUTURE LIVES WOULD BE QUITE MISERABLE AND UNHAPPY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-68 SHE KNEW THAT SHE COULD HELP THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-69 SHE HAD THOUGHT OF A WAY ALREADY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-70 YET SHE DID NOT TELL THEM AT ONCE WHAT IT WAS BECAUSE SHE MUST ASK OZMA'S CONSENT BEFORE SHE WOULD BE ABLE TO CARRY OUT HER PLANS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-71 SO SHE ONLY SAID, IF YOU WILL PROMISE NOT TO WORRY A BIT ABOUT ME I'LL GO TO THE LAND OF OZ THIS VERY AFTERNOON.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-72 AND I'LL MAKE A PROMISE TOO,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-73 THAT YOU SHALL BOTH SEE ME AGAIN BEFORE THE DAY COMES WHEN YOU MUST LEAVE THIS FARM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-74 THE DAY ISN'T FAR AWAY NOW HER UNCLE SADLY REPLIED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-75 I DID NOT TELL YOU OF OUR TROUBLE UNTIL I WAS OBLIGED TO DEAR DOROTHY SO THE EVIL TIME IS NEAR AT HAND.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-76 BUT IF YOU ARE QUITE SURE YOUR FAIRY FRIENDS WILL GIVE YOU A HOME IT WILL BE BEST FOR YOU TO GO TO THEM AS YOUR AUNT SAYS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-77 THAT WAS WHY DOROTHY WENT TO HER LITTLE ROOM IN THE ATTIC THAT AFTERNOON TAKING WITH HER A SMALL DOG NAMED TOTO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-78 THE DOG HAD CURLY BLACK HAIR AND BIG BROWN EYES AND LOVED DOROTHY VERY DEARLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-79 THE CHILD HAD KISSED HER UNCLE AND AUNT AFFECTIONATELY BEFORE SHE WENT UPSTAIRS AND NOW SHE LOOKED AROUND HER LITTLE ROOM RATHER WISTFULLY GAZING AT THE SIMPLE TRINKETS AND WORN CALICO AND GINGHAM DRESSES AS IF THEY WERE OLD FRIENDS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-80 SHE WAS TEMPTED AT FIRST TO MAKE A BUNDLE OF THEM YET SHE KNEW VERY WELL THAT THEY WOULD BE OF NO USE TO HER IN HER FUTURE LIFE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-81 SHE SAT DOWN UPON A BROKEN BACKED CHAIR THE ONLY ONE THE ROOM CONTAINED AND HOLDING TOTO IN HER ARMS WAITED PATIENTLY UNTIL THE CLOCK STRUCK FOUR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-82 THEN SHE MADE THE SECRET SIGNAL THAT HAD BEEN AGREED UPON BETWEEN HER AND OZMA.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-83 UNCLE HENRY AND AUNT EM WAITED DOWNSTAIRS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-84 THEY WERE UNEASY AND A GOOD DEAL EXCITED FOR THIS IS A PRACTICAL HUMDRUM WORLD AND IT SEEMED TO THEM QUITE IMPOSSIBLE THAT THEIR LITTLE NIECE COULD VANISH FROM HER HOME AND TRAVEL INSTANTLY TO FAIRYLAND.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-85 SO THEY WATCHED THE STAIRS WHICH SEEMED TO BE THE ONLY WAY THAT DOROTHY COULD GET OUT OF THE FARMHOUSE AND THEY WATCHED THEM A LONG TIME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-86 THEY HEARD THE CLOCK STRIKE FOUR BUT THERE WAS NO SOUND FROM ABOVE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-87 HALF PAST FOUR CAME AND NOW THEY WERE TOO IMPATIENT TO WAIT ANY LONGER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-88 SOFTLY THEY CREPT UP THE STAIRS TO THE DOOR OF THE LITTLE GIRL'S ROOM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-89 DOROTHY!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-90 DOROTHY!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-91 THEY CALLED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-92 THERE WAS NO ANSWER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-93 THEY OPENED THE DOOR AND LOOKED IN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-02-94 THE ROOM WAS EMPTY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-01 CHAPTER THREE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-02 HOW OZMA GRANTED DOROTHY'S REQUEST I SUPPOSE YOU HAVE READ SO MUCH ABOUT THE MAGNIFICENT EMERALD CITY THAT THERE IS LITTLE NEED FOR ME TO DESCRIBE IT HERE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-03 IT IS THE CAPITAL CITY OF THE LAND OF OZ WHICH IS JUSTLY CONSIDERED THE MOST ATTRACTIVE AND DELIGHTFUL FAIRYLAND IN ALL THE WORLD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-04 THE EMERALD CITY IS BUILT ALL OF BEAUTIFUL MARBLES IN WHICH ARE SET A PROFUSION OF EMERALDS EVERY ONE EXQUISITELY CUT AND OF VERY GREAT SIZE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-05 THERE ARE OTHER JEWELS USED IN THE DECORATIONS INSIDE THE HOUSES AND PALACES SUCH AS RUBIES DIAMONDS SAPPHIRES AMETHYSTS AND TURQUOISES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-06 BUT IN THE STREETS AND UPON THE OUTSIDE OF THE BUILDINGS ONLY EMERALDS APPEAR FROM WHICH CIRCUMSTANCE THE PLACE IS NAMED THE EMERALD CITY OF OZ. IT HAS NINE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY FOUR BUILDINGS IN WHICH LIVED FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN PEOPLE UP TO THE TIME MY STORY OPENS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-07 ALL THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY EXTENDING TO THE BORDERS OF THE DESERT WHICH ENCLOSED IT UPON EVERY SIDE WAS FULL OF PRETTY AND COMFORTABLE FARMHOUSES IN WHICH RESIDED THOSE INHABITANTS OF OZ WHO PREFERRED COUNTRY TO CITY LIFE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-08 ALTOGETHER THERE WERE MORE THAN HALF A MILLION PEOPLE IN THE LAND OF OZ ALTHOUGH SOME OF THEM AS YOU WILL SOON LEARN WERE NOT MADE OF FLESH AND BLOOD AS WE ARE AND EVERY INHABITANT OF THAT FAVORED COUNTRY WAS HAPPY AND PROSPEROUS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-09 NO DISEASE OF ANY SORT WAS EVER KNOWN AMONG THE OZITES AND SO NO ONE EVER DIED UNLESS HE MET WITH AN ACCIDENT THAT PREVENTED HIM FROM LIVING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-10 THIS HAPPENED VERY SELDOM INDEED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-11 THERE WERE NO POOR PEOPLE IN THE LAND OF OZ BECAUSE THERE WAS NO SUCH THING AS MONEY AND ALL PROPERTY OF EVERY SORT BELONGED TO THE RULER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-12 THE PEOPLE WERE HER CHILDREN AND SHE CARED FOR THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-13 EACH PERSON WAS GIVEN FREELY BY HIS NEIGHBORS WHATEVER HE REQUIRED FOR HIS USE WHICH IS AS MUCH AS ANY ONE MAY REASONABLY DESIRE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-14 SOME TILLED THE LANDS AND RAISED GREAT CROPS OF GRAIN WHICH WAS DIVIDED EQUALLY AMONG THE ENTIRE POPULATION SO THAT ALL HAD ENOUGH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-15 THERE WERE MANY TAILORS AND DRESSMAKERS AND SHOEMAKERS AND THE LIKE WHO MADE THINGS THAT ANY WHO DESIRED THEM MIGHT WEAR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-16 LIKEWISE THERE WERE JEWELERS WHO MADE ORNAMENTS FOR THE PERSON WHICH PLEASED AND BEAUTIFIED THE PEOPLE AND THESE ORNAMENTS ALSO WERE FREE TO THOSE WHO ASKED FOR THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-17 EACH MAN AND WOMAN NO MATTER WHAT HE OR SHE PRODUCED FOR THE GOOD OF THE COMMUNITY WAS SUPPLIED BY THE NEIGHBORS WITH FOOD AND CLOTHING AND A HOUSE AND FURNITURE AND ORNAMENTS AND GAMES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-18 IF BY CHANCE THE SUPPLY EVER RAN SHORT MORE WAS TAKEN FROM THE GREAT STOREHOUSES OF THE RULER WHICH WERE AFTERWARD FILLED UP AGAIN WHEN THERE WAS MORE OF ANY ARTICLE THAN THE PEOPLE NEEDED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-19 EVERY ONE WORKED HALF THE TIME AND PLAYED HALF THE TIME AND THE PEOPLE ENJOYED THE WORK AS MUCH AS THEY DID THE PLAY BECAUSE IT IS GOOD TO BE OCCUPIED AND TO HAVE SOMETHING TO DO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-20 THERE WERE NO CRUEL OVERSEERS SET TO WATCH THEM AND NO ONE TO REBUKE THEM OR TO FIND FAULT WITH THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-21 SO EACH ONE WAS PROUD TO DO ALL HE COULD FOR HIS FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS AND WAS GLAD WHEN THEY WOULD ACCEPT THE THINGS HE PRODUCED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-22 YOU WILL KNOW BY WHAT I HAVE HERE TOLD YOU THAT THE LAND OF OZ WAS A REMARKABLE COUNTRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-23 I DO NOT SUPPOSE SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT WOULD BE PRACTICAL WITH US BUT DOROTHY ASSURES ME THAT IT WORKS FINELY WITH THE OZ PEOPLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-24 OZ BEING A FAIRY COUNTRY THE PEOPLE WERE OF COURSE FAIRY PEOPLE,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-25 BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT ALL OF THEM WERE VERY UNLIKE THE PEOPLE OF OUR OWN WORLD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-26 THERE WERE ALL SORTS OF QUEER CHARACTERS AMONG THEM BUT NOT A SINGLE ONE WHO WAS EVIL OR WHO POSSESSED A SELFISH OR VIOLENT NATURE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-27 THEY WERE PEACEFUL KIND HEARTED LOVING AND MERRY AND EVERY INHABITANT ADORED THE BEAUTIFUL GIRL WHO RULED THEM AND DELIGHTED TO OBEY HER EVERY COMMAND.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-28 IN SPITE OF ALL I HAVE SAID IN A GENERAL WAY THERE WERE SOME PARTS OF THE LAND OF OZ NOT QUITE SO PLEASANT AS THE FARMING COUNTRY AND THE EMERALD CITY WHICH WAS ITS CENTER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-29 FAR AWAY IN THE SOUTH COUNTRY THERE LIVED IN THE MOUNTAINS A BAND OF STRANGE PEOPLE CALLED HAMMER HEADS BECAUSE THEY HAD NO ARMS AND USED THEIR FLAT HEADS TO POUND ANY ONE WHO CAME NEAR THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-30 THEIR NECKS WERE LIKE RUBBER SO THAT THEY COULD SHOOT OUT THEIR HEADS TO QUITE A DISTANCE AND AFTERWARD DRAW THEM BACK AGAIN TO THEIR SHOULDERS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-31 THE HAMMER HEADS WERE CALLED THE WILD PEOPLE BUT NEVER HARMED ANY BUT THOSE WHO DISTURBED THEM IN THE MOUNTAINS WHERE THEY LIVED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-32 IN SOME OF THE DENSE FORESTS THERE LIVED GREAT BEASTS OF EVERY SORT,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-33 YET THESE WERE FOR THE MOST PART HARMLESS AND EVEN SOCIABLE AND CONVERSED AGREEABLY WITH THOSE WHO VISITED THEIR HAUNTS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-34 THE KALIDAHS BEASTS WITH BODIES LIKE BEARS AND HEADS LIKE TIGERS HAD ONCE BEEN FIERCE AND BLOODTHIRSTY BUT EVEN THEY WERE NOW NEARLY ALL TAMED ALTHOUGH AT TIMES ONE OR ANOTHER OF THEM WOULD GET CROSS AND DISAGREEABLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-35 NOT SO TAME WERE THE FIGHTING TREES WHICH HAD A FOREST OF THEIR OWN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-36 IF ANY ONE APPROACHED THEM THESE CURIOUS TREES WOULD BEND DOWN THEIR BRANCHES TWINE THEM AROUND THE INTRUDERS AND HURL THEM AWAY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-37 BUT THESE UNPLEASANT THINGS EXISTED ONLY IN A FEW REMOTE PARTS OF THE LAND OF OZ. I SUPPOSE EVERY COUNTRY HAS SOME DRAWBACKS SO EVEN THIS ALMOST PERFECT FAIRYLAND COULD NOT BE QUITE PERFECT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-38 ONCE THERE HAD BEEN WICKED WITCHES IN THE LAND TOO,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-39 BUT NOW THESE HAD ALL BEEN DESTROYED,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-40 SO AS I SAID ONLY PEACE AND HAPPINESS REIGNED IN OZ. FOR SOME TIME OZMA HAD RULED OVER THIS FAIR COUNTRY AND NEVER WAS RULER MORE POPULAR OR BELOVED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-41 SHE IS SAID TO BE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRL THE WORLD HAS EVER KNOWN AND HER HEART AND MIND ARE AS LOVELY AS HER PERSON.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-42 DOROTHY GALE HAD SEVERAL TIMES VISITED THE EMERALD CITY AND EXPERIENCED ADVENTURES IN THE LAND OF OZ SO THAT SHE AND OZMA HAD NOW BECOME FIRM FRIENDS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-43 THE GIRL RULER HAD EVEN MADE DOROTHY A PRINCESS OF OZ AND HAD OFTEN IMPLORED HER TO COME TO OZMA'S STATELY PALACE AND LIVE THERE ALWAYS,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-44 BUT DOROTHY HAD BEEN LOYAL TO HER AUNT EM AND UNCLE HENRY WHO HAD CARED FOR HER SINCE SHE WAS A BABY AND SHE HAD REFUSED TO LEAVE THEM BECAUSE SHE KNEW THEY WOULD BE LONELY WITHOUT HER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-45 HOWEVER DOROTHY NOW REALIZED THAT THINGS WERE GOING TO BE DIFFERENT WITH HER UNCLE AND AUNT FROM THIS TIME FORTH SO AFTER GIVING THE MATTER DEEP THOUGHT SHE DECIDED TO ASK OZMA TO GRANT HER A VERY GREAT FAVOR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-46 A FEW SECONDS AFTER SHE HAD MADE THE SECRET SIGNAL IN HER LITTLE BEDCHAMBER THE KANSAS GIRL WAS SEATED IN A LOVELY ROOM IN OZMA'S PALACE IN THE EMERALD CITY OF OZ. WHEN THE FIRST LOVING KISSES AND EMBRACES HAD BEEN EXCHANGED THE FAIR RULER INQUIRED, WHAT IS THE MATTER DEAR?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-47 I KNOW SOMETHING UNPLEASANT HAS HAPPENED TO YOU FOR YOUR FACE WAS VERY SOBER WHEN I SAW IT IN MY MAGIC PICTURE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-48 AND WHENEVER YOU SIGNAL ME TO TRANSPORT YOU TO THIS SAFE PLACE WHERE YOU ARE ALWAYS WELCOME I KNOW YOU ARE IN DANGER OR IN TROUBLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-49 DOROTHY SIGHED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-50 THIS TIME OZMA IT ISN'T I SHE REPLIED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-51 BUT IT'S WORSE I GUESS FOR UNCLE HENRY AND AUNT EM ARE IN A HEAP OF TROUBLE AND THERE SEEMS NO WAY FOR THEM TO GET OUT OF IT ANYHOW NOT WHILE THEY LIVE IN KANSAS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-52 TELL ME ABOUT IT DOROTHY SAID OZMA WITH READY SYMPATHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-53 WHY YOU SEE UNCLE HENRY IS POOR,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-54 FOR THE FARM IN KANSAS DOESN'T MOUNT TO MUCH AS FARMS GO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-55 SO ONE DAY UNCLE HENRY BORROWED SOME MONEY AND WROTE A LETTER SAYING THAT IF HE DIDN'T PAY THE MONEY BACK THEY COULD TAKE HIS FARM FOR PAY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-56 COURSE HE SPECTED TO PAY BY MAKING MONEY FROM THE FARM,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-57 BUT HE JUST COULDN'T.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-58 AN SO THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE THE FARM AND UNCLE HENRY AND AUNT EM WON'T HAVE ANY PLACE TO LIVE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-59 THEY'RE PRETTY OLD TO DO MUCH HARD WORK OZMA,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-60 SO I'LL HAVE TO WORK FOR THEM UNLESS OZMA HAD BEEN THOUGHTFUL DURING THE STORY BUT NOW SHE SMILED AND PRESSED HER LITTLE FRIEND'S HAND.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-61 UNLESS WHAT DEAR?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-62 SHE ASKED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-63 DOROTHY HESITATED BECAUSE HER REQUEST MEANT SO MUCH TO THEM ALL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-64 WELL SAID SHE I'D LIKE TO LIVE HERE IN THE LAND OF OZ WHERE YOU'VE OFTEN VITED ME TO LIVE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-65 BUT I CAN'T YOU KNOW UNLESS UNCLE HENRY AND AUNT EM COULD LIVE HERE TOO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-66 OF COURSE NOT EXCLAIMED THE RULER OF OZ LAUGHING GAILY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-67 SO IN ORDER TO GET YOU LITTLE FRIEND WE MUST INVITE YOUR UNCLE AND AUNT TO LIVE IN OZ ALSO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-68 OH WILL YOU OZMA?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-69 CRIED DOROTHY CLASPING HER CHUBBY LITTLE HANDS EAGERLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-70 WILL YOU BRING THEM HERE WITH THE MAGIC BELT AND GIVE THEM A NICE LITTLE FARM IN THE MUNCHKIN COUNTRY OR THE WINKIE COUNTRY OR SOME OTHER PLACE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-71 TO BE SURE ANSWERED OZMA FULL OF JOY AT THE CHANCE TO PLEASE HER LITTLE FRIEND.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-72 I HAVE LONG BEEN THINKING OF THIS VERY THING DOROTHY DEAR AND OFTEN I HAVE HAD IT IN MY MIND TO PROPOSE IT TO YOU.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-73 I AM SURE YOUR UNCLE AND AUNT MUST BE GOOD AND WORTHY PEOPLE OR YOU WOULD NOT LOVE THEM SO MUCH,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-74 AND FOR YOUR FRIENDS PRINCESS THERE IS ALWAYS ROOM IN THE LAND OF OZ. DOROTHY WAS DELIGHTED YET NOT ALTOGETHER SURPRISED FOR SHE HAD CLUNG TO THE HOPE THAT OZMA WOULD BE KIND ENOUGH TO GRANT HER REQUEST.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-75 WHEN INDEED HAD HER POWERFUL AND FAITHFUL FRIEND REFUSED HER ANYTHING?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-76 BUT YOU MUST NOT CALL ME PRINCESS' SHE SAID,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-77 FOR AFTER THIS I SHALL LIVE ON THE LITTLE FARM WITH UNCLE HENRY AND AUNT EM AND PRINCESSES OUGHT NOT TO LIVE ON FARMS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-78 PRINCESS DOROTHY WILL NOT REPLIED OZMA WITH HER SWEET SMILE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-79 YOU ARE GOING TO LIVE IN YOUR OWN ROOMS IN THIS PALACE AND BE MY CONSTANT COMPANION.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-80 BUT UNCLE HENRY BEGAN DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-81 OH HE IS OLD AND HAS WORKED ENOUGH IN HIS LIFETIME INTERRUPTED THE GIRL RULER,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-82 SO WE MUST FIND A PLACE FOR YOUR UNCLE AND AUNT WHERE THEY WILL BE COMFORTABLE AND HAPPY AND NEED NOT WORK MORE THAN THEY CARE TO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-83 WHEN SHALL WE TRANSPORT THEM HERE DOROTHY?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-84 I PROMISED TO GO AND SEE THEM AGAIN BEFORE THEY WERE TURNED OUT OF THE FARMHOUSE ANSWERED DOROTHY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-85 SO PERHAPS NEXT SATURDAY BUT WHY WAIT SO LONG?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-86 ASKED OZMA.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-87 AND WHY MAKE THE JOURNEY BACK TO KANSAS AGAIN?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-88 LET US SURPRISE THEM AND BRING THEM HERE WITHOUT ANY WARNING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-89 I'M NOT SURE THAT THEY BELIEVE IN THE LAND OF OZ SAID DOROTHY THOUGH I'VE TOLD EM BOUT IT LOTS OF TIMES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-90 THEY'LL BELIEVE WHEN THEY SEE IT DECLARED OZMA,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-91 AND IF THEY ARE TOLD THEY ARE TO MAKE A MAGICAL JOURNEY TO OUR FAIRYLAND IT MAY MAKE THEM NERVOUS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-92 I THINK THE BEST WAY WILL BE TO USE THE MAGIC BELT WITHOUT WARNING THEM AND WHEN THEY HAVE ARRIVED YOU CAN EXPLAIN TO THEM WHATEVER THEY DO NOT UNDERSTAND.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-93 PERHAPS THAT'S BEST DECIDED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-94 THERE ISN'T MUCH USE IN THEIR STAYING AT THE FARM UNTIL THEY ARE PUT OUT CAUSE IT'S MUCH NICER HERE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-95 THEN TO MORROW MORNING THEY SHALL COME HERE SAID PRINCESS OZMA.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-96 I WILL ORDER JELLIA JAMB WHO IS THE PALACE HOUSEKEEPER TO HAVE ROOMS ALL PREPARED FOR THEM AND AFTER BREAKFAST WE WILL GET THE MAGIC BELT AND BY ITS AID TRANSPORT YOUR UNCLE AND AUNT TO THE EMERALD CITY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-97 THANK YOU OZMA!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-98 CRIED DOROTHY KISSING HER FRIEND GRATEFULLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-99 AND NOW OZMA PROPOSED LET US TAKE A WALK IN THE GARDENS BEFORE WE DRESS FOR DINNER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-03-100 COME DOROTHY DEAR!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-01 CHAPTER FOUR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-02 HOW THE NOME KING PLANNED REVENGE THE REASON MOST PEOPLE ARE BAD IS BECAUSE THEY DO NOT TRY TO BE GOOD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-03 NOW THE NOME KING HAD NEVER TRIED TO BE GOOD SO HE WAS VERY BAD INDEED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-04 HAVING DECIDED TO CONQUER THE LAND OF OZ AND TO DESTROY THE EMERALD CITY AND ENSLAVE ALL ITS PEOPLE KING ROQUAT THE RED KEPT PLANNING WAYS TO DO THIS DREADFUL THING AND THE MORE HE PLANNED THE MORE HE BELIEVED HE WOULD BE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-05 ABOUT THE TIME DOROTHY WENT TO OZMA THE NOME KING CALLED HIS CHIEF STEWARD TO HIM AND SAID, KALIKO I THINK I SHALL MAKE YOU THE GENERAL OF MY ARMIES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-06 I THINK YOU WON'T REPLIED KALIKO POSITIVELY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-07 WHY NOT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-08 INQUIRED THE KING REACHING FOR HIS SCEPTER WITH THE BIG SAPPHIRE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-09 BECAUSE I'M YOUR CHIEF STEWARD AND KNOW NOTHING OF WARFARE SAID KALIKO PREPARING TO DODGE IF ANYTHING WERE THROWN AT HIM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-10 I MANAGE ALL THE AFFAIRS OF YOUR KINGDOM BETTER THAN YOU COULD YOURSELF AND YOU'LL NEVER FIND ANOTHER STEWARD AS GOOD AS I AM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-11 BUT THERE ARE A HUNDRED NOMES BETTER FITTED TO COMMAND YOUR ARMY AND YOUR GENERALS GET THROWN AWAY SO OFTEN THAT I HAVE NO DESIRE TO BE ONE OF THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-12 AH THERE IS SOME TRUTH IN YOUR REMARKS KALIKO REMARKED THE KING DECIDING NOT TO THROW THE SCEPTER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-13 SUMMON MY ARMY TO ASSEMBLE IN THE GREAT CAVERN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-14 KALIKO BOWED AND RETIRED AND IN A FEW MINUTES RETURNED TO SAY THAT THE ARMY WAS ASSEMBLED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-15 SO THE KING WENT OUT UPON A BALCONY THAT OVERLOOKED THE GREAT CAVERN WHERE FIFTY THOUSAND NOMES ALL ARMED WITH SWORDS AND PIKES STOOD MARSHALED IN MILITARY ARRAY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-16 WHEN THEY WERE NOT REQUIRED AS SOLDIERS ALL THESE NOMES WERE METAL WORKERS AND MINERS AND THEY HAD HAMMERED SO MUCH AT THE FORGES AND DUG SO HARD WITH PICK AND SHOVEL THAT THEY HAD ACQUIRED GREAT MUSCULAR STRENGTH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-17 THEY WERE STRANGELY FORMED CREATURES RATHER ROUND AND NOT VERY TALL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-18 THEIR TOES WERE CURLY AND THEIR EARS BROAD AND FLAT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-19 IN TIME OF WAR EVERY NOME LEFT HIS FORGE OR MINE AND BECAME PART OF THE GREAT ARMY OF KING ROQUAT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-20 THE SOLDIERS WORE ROCK COLORED UNIFORMS AND WERE EXCELLENTLY DRILLED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-21 THE KING LOOKED UPON THIS TREMENDOUS ARMY WHICH STOOD SILENTLY ARRAYED BEFORE HIM AND A CRUEL SMILE CURLED THE CORNERS OF HIS MOUTH FOR HE SAW THAT HIS LEGIONS WERE VERY POWERFUL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-22 THEN HE ADDRESSED THEM FROM THE BALCONY SAYING, I HAVE THROWN AWAY GENERAL BLUG BECAUSE HE DID NOT PLEASE ME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-23 SO I WANT ANOTHER GENERAL TO COMMAND THIS ARMY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-24 WHO IS NEXT IN COMMAND?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-25 I AM REPLIED COLONEL CRINKLE A DAPPER LOOKING NOME AS HE STEPPED FORWARD TO SALUTE HIS MONARCH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-26 THE KING LOOKED AT HIM CAREFULLY AND SAID, I WANT YOU TO MARCH THIS ARMY THROUGH AN UNDERGROUND TUNNEL WHICH I AM GOING TO BORE TO THE EMERALD CITY OF OZ. WHEN YOU GET THERE I WANT YOU TO CONQUER THE OZ PEOPLE DESTROY THEM AND THEIR CITY AND BRING ALL THEIR GOLD AND SILVER AND PRECIOUS STONES BACK TO MY CAVERN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-27 ALSO YOU ARE TO RECAPTURE MY MAGIC BELT AND RETURN IT TO ME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-28 WILL YOU DO THIS GENERAL CRINKLE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-29 NO YOUR MAJESTY REPLIED THE NOME,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-30 FOR IT CAN'T BE DONE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-31 OH INDEED!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-32 EXCLAIMED THE KING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-33 THEN HE TURNED TO HIS SERVANTS AND SAID, PLEASE TAKE GENERAL CRINKLE TO THE TORTURE CHAMBER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-34 THERE YOU WILL KINDLY SLICE HIM INTO THIN SLICES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-35 AFTERWARD YOU MAY FEED HIM TO THE SEVEN HEADED DOGS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-36 ANYTHING TO OBLIGE YOUR MAJESTY REPLIED THE SERVANTS POLITELY AND LED THE CONDEMNED MAN AWAY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-37 WHEN THEY HAD GONE THE KING ADDRESSED THE ARMY AGAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-38 LISTEN!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-39 SAID HE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-40 THE GENERAL WHO IS TO COMMAND MY ARMIES MUST PROMISE TO CARRY OUT MY ORDERS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-41 IF HE FAILS HE WILL SHARE THE FATE OF POOR CRINKLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-42 NOW THEN WHO WILL VOLUNTEER TO LEAD MY HOSTS TO THE EMERALD CITY?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-43 FOR A TIME NO ONE MOVED AND ALL WERE SILENT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-44 THEN AN OLD NOME WITH WHITE WHISKERS SO LONG THAT THEY WERE TIED AROUND HIS WAIST TO PREVENT THEIR TRIPPING HIM UP STEPPED OUT OF THE RANKS AND SALUTED THE KING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-45 I'D LIKE TO ASK A FEW QUESTIONS YOUR MAJESTY HE SAID.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-46 GO AHEAD REPLIED THE KING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-47 THESE OZ PEOPLE ARE QUITE GOOD ARE THEY NOT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-48 AS GOOD AS APPLE PIE SAID THE KING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-49 AND THEY ARE HAPPY I SUPPOSE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-50 CONTINUED THE OLD NOME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-51 HAPPY AS THE DAY IS LONG SAID THE KING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-52 AND CONTENTED AND PROSPEROUS?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-53 INQUIRED THE NOME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-54 VERY MUCH SO SAID THE KING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-55 WELL YOUR MAJESTY REMARKED HE OF THE WHITE WHISKERS I THINK I SHOULD LIKE TO UNDERTAKE THE JOB SO I'LL BE YOUR GENERAL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-56 I HATE GOOD PEOPLE,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-57 I DETEST HAPPY PEOPLE,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-58 I'M OPPOSED TO ANY ONE WHO IS CONTENTED AND PROSPEROUS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-59 THAT IS WHY I AM SO FOND OF YOUR MAJESTY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-60 MAKE ME YOUR GENERAL AND I'LL PROMISE TO CONQUER AND DESTROY THE OZ PEOPLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-61 IF I FAIL I'M READY TO BE SLICED THIN AND FED TO THE SEVEN HEADED DOGS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-62 VERY GOOD!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-63 VERY GOOD INDEED!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-64 THE WAY TO TALK!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-65 CRIED ROQUAT THE RED WHO WAS GREATLY PLEASED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-66 WHAT IS YOUR NAME GENERAL?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-67 I'M CALLED GUPH YOUR MAJESTY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-68 WELL GUPH COME WITH ME TO MY PRIVATE CAVE AND WE'LL TALK IT OVER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-69 THEN HE TURNED TO THE ARMY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-70 NOMES AND SOLDIERS SAID HE YOU ARE TO OBEY THE COMMANDS OF GENERAL GUPH UNTIL HE BECOMES DOG FEED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-71 ANY MAN WHO FAILS TO OBEY HIS NEW GENERAL WILL BE PROMPTLY THROWN AWAY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-72 YOU ARE NOW DISMISSED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-73 GUPH WENT TO THE KING'S PRIVATE CAVE AND SAT DOWN UPON AN AMETHYST CHAIR AND PUT HIS FEET ON THE ARM OF THE KING'S RUBY THRONE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-74 THEN HE LIGHTED HIS PIPE AND THREW THE LIVE COAL HE HAD TAKEN FROM HIS POCKET UPON THE KING'S LEFT FOOT AND PUFFED THE SMOKE INTO THE KING'S EYES AND MADE HIMSELF COMFORTABLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-75 FOR HE WAS A WISE OLD NOME AND HE KNEW THAT THE BEST WAY TO GET ALONG WITH ROQUAT THE RED WAS TO SHOW THAT HE WAS NOT AFRAID OF HIM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-76 I'M READY FOR THE TALK YOUR MAJESTY HE SAID.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-77 THE KING COUGHED AND LOOKED AT HIS NEW GENERAL FIERCELY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-78 DO YOU NOT TREMBLE TO TAKE SUCH LIBERTIES WITH YOUR MONARCH?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-79 HE ASKED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-80 OH NO REPLIED GUPH CALMLY AND HE BLEW A WREATH OF SMOKE THAT CURLED AROUND THE KING'S NOSE AND MADE HIM SNEEZE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-81 YOU WANT TO CONQUER THE EMERALD CITY AND I'M THE ONLY NOME IN ALL YOUR DOMINIONS WHO CAN CONQUER IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-82 SO YOU WILL BE VERY CAREFUL NOT TO HURT ME UNTIL I HAVE CARRIED OUT YOUR WISHES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-83 AFTER THAT WELL WHAT THEN?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-84 INQUIRED THE KING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-85 THEN YOU WILL BE SO GRATEFUL TO ME THAT YOU WON'T CARE TO HURT ME REPLIED THE GENERAL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-86 THAT IS A VERY GOOD ARGUMENT SAID ROQUAT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-87 BUT SUPPOSE YOU FAIL?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-88 THEN IT'S THE SLICING MACHINE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-89 I AGREE TO THAT ANNOUNCED GUPH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-90 BUT IF YOU DO AS I TELL YOU THERE WILL BE NO FAILURE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-91 THE TROUBLE WITH YOU ROQUAT IS THAT YOU DON'T THINK CAREFULLY ENOUGH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-92 I DO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-93 YOU WOULD GO AHEAD AND MARCH THROUGH YOUR TUNNEL INTO OZ AND GET DEFEATED AND DRIVEN BACK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-94 I WON'T.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-95 AND THE REASON I WON'T IS BECAUSE WHEN I MARCH I'LL HAVE ALL MY PLANS MADE AND A HOST OF ALLIES TO ASSIST MY NOMES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-96 WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-97 ASKED THE KING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-98 I'LL EXPLAIN KING ROQUAT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-99 YOU'RE GOING TO ATTACK A FAIRY COUNTRY AND A MIGHTY FAIRY COUNTRY TOO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-100 THEY HAVEN'T MUCH OF AN ARMY IN OZ BUT THE PRINCESS WHO RULED THEM HAS A FAIRY WAND,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-101 AND THE LITTLE GIRL DOROTHY HAS YOUR MAGIC BELT,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-102 AND AT THE NORTH OF THE EMERALD CITY LIVES A CLEVER SORCERESS CALLED GLINDA THE GOOD WHO COMMANDS THE SPIRITS OF THE AIR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-103 ALSO I HAVE HEARD THAT THERE IS A WONDERFUL WIZARD IN OZMA'S PALACE WHO IS SO SKILLFUL THAT PEOPLE USED TO PAY HIM MONEY IN AMERICA TO SEE HIM PERFORM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-104 SO YOU SEE IT WILL BE NO EASY THING TO OVERCOME ALL THIS MAGIC.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-105 WE HAVE FIFTY THOUSAND SOLDIERS!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-106 CRIED THE KING PROUDLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-107 YES,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-108 BUT THEY ARE NOMES REMARKED GUPH TAKING A SILK HANDKERCHIEF FROM THE KING'S POCKET AND WIPING HIS OWN POINTED SHOES WITH IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-109 NOMES ARE IMMORTALS BUT THEY ARE NOT STRONG ON MAGIC.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-110 WHEN YOU LOST YOUR FAMOUS BELT THE GREATER PART OF YOUR OWN POWER WAS GONE FROM YOU.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-111 AGAINST OZMA YOU AND YOUR NOMES WOULD HAVE NO SHOW AT ALL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-112 ROQUAT'S EYES FLASHED ANGRILY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-113 THEN AWAY YOU GO TO THE SLICING MACHINE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-114 HE CRIED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-115 NOT YET SAID THE GENERAL FILLING HIS PIPE FROM THE KING'S PRIVATE TOBACCO POUCH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-116 WHAT DO YOU PROPOSE TO DO?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-117 ASKED THE MONARCH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-118 I PROPOSE TO OBTAIN THE POWER WE NEED ANSWERED GUPH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-119 THERE ARE A GOOD MANY EVIL CREATURES WHO HAVE MAGIC POWERS SUFFICIENT TO DESTROY AND CONQUER THE LAND OF OZ. WE WILL GET THEM ON OUR SIDE BAND THEM ALL TOGETHER AND THEN TAKE OZMA AND HER PEOPLE BY SURPRISE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-120 IT'S ALL VERY SIMPLE AND EASY WHEN YOU KNOW HOW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-121 ALONE WE SHOULD BE HELPLESS TO INJURE THE RULER OF OZ BUT WITH THE AID OF THE EVIL POWERS WE CAN SUMMON WE SHALL EASILY SUCCEED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-122 KING ROQUAT WAS DELIGHTED WITH THIS IDEA FOR HE REALIZED HOW CLEVER IT WAS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-123 SURELY GUPH YOU ARE THE GREATEST GENERAL I HAVE EVER HAD!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-124 HE EXCLAIMED HIS EYES SPARKLING WITH JOY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-125 YOU MUST GO AT ONCE AND MAKE ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE EVIL POWERS TO ASSIST US AND MEANTIME I'LL BEGIN TO DIG THE TUNNEL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-126 I THOUGHT YOU'D AGREE WITH ME ROQUAT REPLIED THE NEW GENERAL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-04-127 I'LL START THIS VERY AFTERNOON TO VISIT THE CHIEF OF THE WHIMSIES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-01 CHAPTER FIVE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-02 HOW DOROTHY BECAME A PRINCESS WHEN THE PEOPLE OF THE EMERALD CITY HEARD THAT DOROTHY HAD RETURNED TO THEM EVERY ONE WAS EAGER TO SEE HER FOR THE LITTLE GIRL WAS A GENERAL FAVORITE IN THE LAND OF OZ. FROM TIME TO TIME SOME OF THE FOLK FROM THE GREAT OUTSIDE WORLD HAD FOUND THEIR WAY INTO THIS FAIRYLAND BUT ALL EXCEPT ONE HAD BEEN COMPANIONS OF DOROTHY AND HAD TURNED OUT TO BE VERY AGREEABLE PEOPLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-03 THE EXCEPTION I SPEAK OF WAS THE WONDERFUL WIZARD OF OZ A SLEIGHT OF HAND PERFORMER FROM OMAHA WHO WENT UP IN A BALLOON AND WAS CARRIED BY A CURRENT OF AIR TO THE EMERALD CITY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-04 HIS QUEER AND PUZZLING TRICKS MADE THE PEOPLE OF OZ BELIEVE HIM A GREAT WIZARD FOR A TIME AND HE RULED OVER THEM UNTIL DOROTHY ARRIVED ON HER FIRST VISIT AND SHOWED THE WIZARD TO BE A MERE HUMBUG.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-05 HE WAS A GENTLE KIND HEARTED LITTLE MAN AND DOROTHY GREW TO LIKE HIM AFTERWARD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-06 WHEN AFTER AN ABSENCE THE WIZARD RETURNED TO THE LAND OF OZ OZMA RECEIVED HIM GRACIOUSLY AND GAVE HIM A HOME IN A PART OF THE PALACE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-07 IN ADDITION TO THE WIZARD TWO OTHER PERSONAGES FROM THE OUTSIDE WORLD HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO MAKE THEIR HOME IN THE EMERALD CITY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-08 THE FIRST WAS A QUAINT SHAGGY MAN WHOM OZMA HAD MADE THE GOVERNOR OF THE ROYAL STOREHOUSES AND THE SECOND A YELLOW HEN NAMED BILLINA WHO HAD A FINE HOUSE IN THE GARDENS BACK OF THE PALACE WHERE SHE LOOKED AFTER A LARGE FAMILY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-09 BOTH THESE HAD BEEN OLD COMRADES OF DOROTHY SO YOU SEE THE LITTLE GIRL WAS QUITE AN IMPORTANT PERSONAGE IN OZ AND THE PEOPLE THOUGHT SHE HAD BROUGHT THEM GOOD LUCK AND LOVED HER NEXT BEST TO OZMA.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-10 DURING HER SEVERAL VISITS THIS LITTLE GIRL HAD BEEN THE MEANS OF DESTROYING TWO WICKED WITCHES WHO OPPRESSED THE PEOPLE AND SHE HAD DISCOVERED A LIVE SCARECROW WHO WAS NOW ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR PERSONAGES IN ALL THE FAIRY COUNTRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-11 WITH THE SCARECROW'S HELP SHE HAD RESCUED NICK CHOPPER A TIN WOODMAN WHO HAD RUSTED IN A LONELY FOREST AND THE TIN MAN WAS NOW THE EMPEROR OF THE COUNTRY OF THE WINKIES AND MUCH BELOVED BECAUSE OF HIS KIND HEART.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-12 NO WONDER THE PEOPLE THOUGHT DOROTHY HAD BROUGHT THEM GOOD LUCK!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-13 YET STRANGE AS IT MAY SEEM SHE HAD ACCOMPLISHED ALL THESE WONDERS NOT BECAUSE SHE WAS A FAIRY OR HAD ANY MAGICAL POWERS WHATEVER BUT BECAUSE SHE WAS A SIMPLE SWEET AND TRUE LITTLE GIRL WHO WAS HONEST TO HERSELF AND TO ALL WHOM SHE MET.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-14 IN THIS WORLD IN WHICH WE LIVE SIMPLICITY AND KINDNESS ARE THE ONLY MAGIC WANDS THAT WORK WONDERS AND IN THE LAND OF OZ DOROTHY FOUND THESE SAME QUALITIES HAD WON FOR HER THE LOVE AND ADMIRATION OF THE PEOPLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-15 INDEED THE LITTLE GIRL HAD MADE MANY WARM FRIENDS IN THE FAIRY COUNTRY AND THE ONLY REAL GRIEF THE OZITES HAD EVER EXPERIENCED WAS WHEN DOROTHY LEFT THEM AND RETURNED TO HER KANSAS HOME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-16 NOW SHE RECEIVED A JOYFUL WELCOME ALTHOUGH NO ONE EXCEPT OZMA KNEW AT FIRST THAT SHE HAD FINALLY COME TO STAY FOR GOOD AND ALL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-17 THAT EVENING DOROTHY HAD MANY CALLERS AND AMONG THEM WERE SUCH IMPORTANT PEOPLE AS TIKTOK A MACHINE MAN WHO THOUGHT AND SPOKE AND MOVED BY CLOCKWORK,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-18 HER OLD COMPANION THE GENIAL SHAGGY MAN,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-19 JACK PUMPKINHEAD WHOSE BODY WAS BRUSH WOOD AND WHOSE HEAD WAS A RIPE PUMPKIN WITH A FACE CARVED UPON IT,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-20 THE COWARDLY LION AND THE HUNGRY TIGER TWO GREAT BEASTS FROM THE FOREST WHO SERVED PRINCESS OZMA AND PROFESSOR H. M. WOGGLEBUG TE THIS WOGGLEBUG WAS A REMARKABLE CREATURE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-21 HE HAD ONCE BEEN A TINY LITTLE BUG CRAWLING AROUND IN A SCHOOL ROOM BUT HE WAS DISCOVERED AND HIGHLY MAGNIFIED SO THAT HE COULD BE SEEN MORE PLAINLY AND WHILE IN THIS MAGNIFIED CONDITION HE HAD ESCAPED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-22 HE HAD ALWAYS REMAINED BIG AND HE DRESSED LIKE A DANDY AND WAS SO FULL OF KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION WHICH ARE DISTINCT ACQUIREMENTS THAT HE HAD BEEN MADE A PROFESSOR AND THE HEAD OF THE ROYAL COLLEGE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-23 DOROTHY HAD A NICE VISIT WITH THESE OLD FRIENDS AND ALSO TALKED A LONG TIME WITH THE WIZARD WHO WAS LITTLE AND OLD AND WITHERED AND DRIED UP BUT AS MERRY AND ACTIVE AS A CHILD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-24 AFTERWARD SHE WENT TO SEE BILLINA'S FAST GROWING FAMILY OF CHICKS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-25 TOTO DOROTHY'S LITTLE BLACK DOG ALSO MET WITH A CORDIAL RECEPTION.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-26 TOTO WAS AN ESPECIAL FRIEND OF THE SHAGGY MAN AND HE KNEW EVERY ONE ELSE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-27 BEING THE ONLY DOG IN THE LAND OF OZ HE WAS HIGHLY RESPECTED BY THE PEOPLE WHO BELIEVED ANIMALS ENTITLED TO EVERY CONSIDERATION IF THEY BEHAVED THEMSELVES PROPERLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-28 DOROTHY HAD FOUR LOVELY ROOMS IN THE PALACE WHICH WERE ALWAYS RESERVED FOR HER USE AND WERE CALLED DOROTHY'S ROOMS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-29 THESE CONSISTED OF A BEAUTIFUL SITTING ROOM A DRESSING ROOM A DAINTY BEDCHAMBER AND A BIG MARBLE BATHROOM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-30 AND IN THESE ROOMS WERE EVERYTHING THAT HEART COULD DESIRE PLACED THERE WITH LOVING THOUGHTFULNESS BY OZMA FOR HER LITTLE FRIEND'S USE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-31 THE ROYAL DRESSMAKERS HAD THE LITTLE GIRL'S MEASURE SO THEY KEPT THE CLOSETS IN HER DRESSING ROOM FILLED WITH LOVELY DRESSES OF EVERY DESCRIPTION AND SUITABLE FOR EVERY OCCASION.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-32 NO WONDER DOROTHY HAD REFRAINED FROM BRINGING WITH HER HER OLD CALICO AND GINGHAM DRESSES!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-33 HERE EVERYTHING THAT WAS DEAR TO A LITTLE GIRL'S HEART WAS SUPPLIED IN PROFUSION AND NOTHING SO RICH AND BEAUTIFUL COULD EVER HAVE BEEN FOUND IN THE BIGGEST DEPARTMENT STORES IN AMERICA.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-34 OF COURSE DOROTHY ENJOYED ALL THESE LUXURIES AND THE ONLY REASON SHE HAD HERETOFORE PREFERRED TO LIVE IN KANSAS WAS BECAUSE HER UNCLE AND AUNT LOVED HER AND NEEDED HER WITH THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-35 NOW HOWEVER ALL WAS TO BE CHANGED AND DOROTHY WAS REALLY MORE DELIGHTED TO KNOW THAT HER DEAR RELATIVES WERE TO SHARE IN HER GOOD FORTUNE AND ENJOY THE DELIGHTS OF THE LAND OF OZ THAN SHE WAS TO POSSESS SUCH LUXURY FOR HERSELF.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-36 NEXT MORNING AT OZMA'S REQUEST DOROTHY DRESSED HERSELF IN A PRETTY SKY BLUE GOWN OF RICH SILK TRIMMED WITH REAL PEARLS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-37 THE BUCKLES OF HER SHOES WERE SET WITH PEARLS TOO AND MORE OF THESE PRICELESS GEMS WERE ON A LOVELY CORONET WHICH SHE WORE UPON HER FOREHEAD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-38 FOR SAID HER FRIEND OZMA FROM THIS TIME FORTH MY DEAR YOU MUST ASSUME YOUR RIGHTFUL RANK AS A PRINCESS OF OZ AND BEING MY CHOSEN COMPANION YOU MUST DRESS IN A WAY BEFITTING THE DIGNITY OF YOUR POSITION.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-39 DOROTHY AGREED TO THIS ALTHOUGH SHE KNEW THAT NEITHER GOWNS NOR JEWELS COULD MAKE HER ANYTHING ELSE THAN THE SIMPLE UNAFFECTED LITTLE GIRL SHE HAD ALWAYS BEEN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-40 AS SOON AS THEY HAD BREAKFASTED THE GIRLS EATING TOGETHER IN OZMA'S PRETTY BOUDOIR THE RULER OF OZ SAID, NOW DEAR FRIEND WE WILL USE THE MAGIC BELT TO TRANSPORT YOUR UNCLE AND AUNT FROM KANSAS TO THE EMERALD CITY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-41 BUT I THINK IT WOULD BE FITTING IN RECEIVING SUCH DISTINGUISHED GUESTS FOR US TO SIT IN MY THRONE ROOM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-42 OH THEY'RE NOT VERY STINGUISHED OZMA SAID DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-43 THEY'RE JUST PLAIN PEOPLE LIKE ME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-44 BEING YOUR FRIENDS AND RELATIVES PRINCESS DOROTHY THEY ARE CERTAINLY DISTINGUISHED REPLIED THE RULER WITH A SMILE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-45 THEY THEY WON'T HARDLY KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF ALL YOUR SPLENDID FURNITURE AND THINGS PROTESTED DOROTHY GRAVELY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-46 IT MAY SCARE EM TO SEE YOUR GRAND THRONE ROOM AN P'RAPS WE'D BETTER GO INTO THE BACK YARD OZMA WHERE THE CABBAGES GROW AN THE CHICKENS ARE PLAYING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-47 THEN IT WOULD SEEM MORE NATURAL TO UNCLE HENRY AND AUNT EM. NO,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-48 THEY SHALL FIRST SEE ME IN MY THRONE ROOM REPLIED OZMA DECIDEDLY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-49 AND WHEN SHE SPOKE IN THAT TONE DOROTHY KNEW IT WAS NOT WISE TO OPPOSE HER FOR OZMA WAS ACCUSTOMED TO HAVING HER OWN WAY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-50 SO TOGETHER THEY WENT TO THE THRONE ROOM AN IMMENSE DOMED CHAMBER IN THE CENTER OF THE PALACE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-51 HERE STOOD THE ROYAL THRONE MADE OF SOLID GOLD AND ENCRUSTED WITH ENOUGH PRECIOUS STONES TO STOCK A DOZEN JEWELRY STORES IN OUR COUNTRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-52 OZMA WHO WAS WEARING THE MAGIC BELT SEATED HERSELF IN THE THRONE AND DOROTHY SAT AT HER FEET.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-53 IN THE ROOM WERE ASSEMBLED MANY LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE COURT CLOTHED IN RICH APPAREL AND WEARING FINE JEWELRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-54 TWO IMMENSE ANIMALS SQUATTED ONE ON EACH SIDE OF THE THRONE THE COWARDLY LION AND THE HUNGRY TIGER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-55 IN A BALCONY HIGH UP IN THE DOME AN ORCHESTRA PLAYED SWEET MUSIC AND BENEATH THE DOME TWO ELECTRIC FOUNTAINS SENT SPRAYS OF COLORED PERFUMED WATER SHOOTING UP NEARLY AS HIGH AS THE ARCHED CEILING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-56 ARE YOU READY DOROTHY?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-57 ASKED THE RULER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-58 I AM REPLIED DOROTHY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-59 BUT I DON'T KNOW WHETHER AUNT EM AND UNCLE HENRY ARE READY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-60 THAT WON'T MATTER DECLARED OZMA.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-61 THE OLD LIFE CAN HAVE VERY LITTLE TO INTEREST THEM AND THE SOONER THEY BEGIN THE NEW LIFE HERE THE HAPPIER THEY WILL BE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-62 HERE THEY COME MY DEAR!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-63 AS SHE SPOKE THERE BEFORE THE THRONE APPEARED UNCLE HENRY AND AUNT EM WHO FOR A MOMENT STOOD MOTIONLESS GLARING WITH WHITE AND STARTLED FACES AT THE SCENE THAT CONFRONTED THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-64 IF THE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN PRESENT HAD NOT BEEN SO POLITE I AM SURE THEY WOULD HAVE LAUGHED AT THE TWO STRANGERS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-65 AUNT EM HAD HER CALICO DRESS SKIRT TUCKED UP AND SHE WORE A FADED BLUE CHECKED APRON.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-66 HER HAIR WAS RATHER STRAGGLY AND SHE HAD ON A PAIR OF UNCLE HENRY'S OLD SLIPPERS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-67 IN ONE HAND SHE HELD A DISH TOWEL AND IN THE OTHER A CRACKED EARTHENWARE PLATE WHICH SHE HAD BEEN ENGAGED IN WIPING WHEN SO SUDDENLY TRANSPORTED TO THE LAND OF OZ. UNCLE HENRY WHEN THE SUMMONS CAME HAD BEEN OUT IN THE BARN DOIN CHORES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-68 HE WORE A RAGGED AND MUCH SOILED STRAW HAT A CHECKED SHIRT WITHOUT ANY COLLAR AND BLUE OVERALLS TUCKED INTO THE TOPS OF HIS OLD COWHIDE BOOTS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-69 BY GUM!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-70 GASPED UNCLE HENRY LOOKING AROUND AS IF BEWILDERED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-71 WELL I SWAN!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-72 GURGLED AUNT EM IN A HOARSE FRIGHTENED VOICE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-73 THEN HER EYES FELL UPON DOROTHY AND SHE SAID, D D D DON'T THAT LOOK LIKE OUR LITTLE GIRL OUR DOROTHY HENRY?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-74 HI THERE LOOK OUT EM!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-75 EXCLAIMED THE OLD MAN AS AUNT EM ADVANCED A STEP,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-76 TAKE CARE O THE WILD BEASTSES OR YOU'RE A GONER!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-77 BUT NOW DOROTHY SPRANG FORWARD AND EMBRACED AND KISSED HER AUNT AND UNCLE AFFECTIONATELY AFTERWARD TAKING THEIR HANDS IN HER OWN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-78 DON'T BE AFRAID SHE SAID TO THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-79 YOU ARE NOW IN THE LAND OF OZ WHERE YOU ARE TO LIVE ALWAYS AND BE COMFER'BLE AN HAPPY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-80 YOU'LL NEVER HAVE TO WORRY OVER ANYTHING AGAIN CAUSE THERE WON'T BE ANYTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-81 AND YOU OWE IT ALL TO THE KINDNESS OF MY FRIEND PRINCESS OZMA.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-82 HERE SHE LED THEM BEFORE THE THRONE AND CONTINUED, YOUR HIGHNESS THIS IS UNCLE HENRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-83 AND THIS IS AUNT EM. THEY WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THEM HERE FROM KANSAS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-84 AUNT EM TRIED TO SLICK HER HAIR AND SHE HID THE DISH TOWEL AND DISH UNDER HER APRON WHILE SHE BOWED TO THE LOVELY OZMA.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-85 UNCLE HENRY TOOK OFF HIS STRAW HAT AND HELD IT AWKWARDLY IN HIS HANDS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-86 BUT THE RULER OF OZ ROSE AND CAME FROM HER THRONE TO GREET HER NEWLY ARRIVED GUESTS AND SHE SMILED AS SWEETLY UPON THEM AS IF THEY HAD BEEN A KING AND QUEEN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-87 YOU ARE VERY WELCOME HERE WHERE I HAVE BROUGHT YOU FOR PRINCESS DOROTHY'S SAKE SHE SAID GRACIOUSLY AND I HOPE YOU WILL BE QUITE HAPPY IN YOUR NEW HOME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-88 THEN SHE TURNED TO HER COURTIERS WHO WERE SILENTLY AND GRAVELY REGARDING THE SCENE AND ADDED, I PRESENT TO MY PEOPLE OUR PRINCESS DOROTHY'S BELOVED UNCLE HENRY AND AUNT EM WHO WILL HEREAFTER BE SUBJECTS OF OUR KINGDOM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-89 IT WILL PLEASE ME TO HAVE YOU SHOW THEM EVERY KINDNESS AND HONOR IN YOUR POWER AND TO JOIN ME IN MAKING THEM HAPPY AND CONTENTED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-90 HEARING THIS ALL THOSE ASSEMBLED BOWED LOW AND RESPECTFULLY TO THE OLD FARMER AND HIS WIFE WHO BOBBED THEIR OWN HEADS IN RETURN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-91 AND NOW SAID OZMA TO THEM DOROTHY WILL SHOW YOU THE ROOMS PREPARED FOR YOU.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-92 I HOPE YOU WILL LIKE THEM AND SHALL EXPECT YOU TO JOIN ME AT LUNCHEON.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-93 SO DOROTHY LED HER RELATIVES AWAY AND AS SOON AS THEY WERE OUT OF THE THRONE ROOM AND ALONE IN THE CORRIDOR AUNT EM SQUEEZED DOROTHY'S HAND AND SAID, CHILD CHILD!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-94 HOW IN THE WORLD DID WE EVER GET HERE SO QUICK?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-95 AND IS IT ALL REAL?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-96 AND ARE WE TO STAY HERE AS SHE SAYS?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-97 AND WHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN ANYHOW?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-98 DOROTHY LAUGHED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-99 WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US WHAT YOU WERE GOIN TO DO?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-100 INQUIRED UNCLE HENRY REPROACHFULLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-101 IF I'D KNOWN ABOUT IT I'D A PUT ON MY SUNDAY CLOTHES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-102 I'LL SPLAIN EVER'THING AS SOON AS WE GET TO YOUR ROOMS PROMISED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-103 YOU'RE IN GREAT LUCK UNCLE HENRY AND AUNT EM,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-104 AN SO AM I!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-105 AND OH!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-106 I'M SO HAPPY TO HAVE GOT YOU HERE AT LAST!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-107 AS HE WALKED BY THE LITTLE GIRL'S SIDE UNCLE HENRY STROKED HIS WHISKERS THOUGHTFULLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-108 PEARS TO ME DOROTHY WE WON'T MAKE BANG UP FAIRIES HE REMARKED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-109 AN MY BACK HAIR LOOKS LIKE A FRIGHT!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-110 WAILED AUNT EM. NEVER MIND RETURNED THE LITTLE GIRL REASSURINGLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-111 YOU WON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO NOW BUT TO LOOK PRETTY AUNT EM,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-112 AN UNCLE HENRY WON'T HAVE TO WORK TILL HIS BACK ACHES THAT'S CERTAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-113 SURE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-114 THEY ASKED WONDERINGLY AND IN THE SAME BREATH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-115 COURSE I'M SURE SAID DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-116 YOU'RE IN THE FAIRYLAND OF OZ NOW,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-05-117 AN WHAT'S MORE YOU BELONG TO IT!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-06-01 CHAPTER SIX.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-06-02 HOW GUPH VISITED THE WHIMSIES THE NEW GENERAL OF THE NOME KING'S ARMY KNEW PERFECTLY WELL THAT TO FAIL IN HIS PLANS MEANT DEATH FOR HIM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-06-03 YET HE WAS NOT AT ALL ANXIOUS OR WORRIED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-06-04 HE HATED EVERY ONE WHO WAS GOOD AND LONGED TO MAKE ALL WHO WERE HAPPY UNHAPPY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-06-05 THEREFORE HE HAD ACCEPTED THIS DANGEROUS POSITION AS GENERAL QUITE WILLINGLY FEELING SURE IN HIS EVIL MIND THAT HE WOULD BE ABLE TO DO A LOT OF MISCHIEF AND FINALLY CONQUER THE LAND OF OZ. YET GUPH DETERMINED TO BE CAREFUL AND TO LAY HIS PLANS WELL SO AS NOT TO FAIL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-06-06 HE ARGUED THAT ONLY CARELESS PEOPLE FAIL IN WHAT THEY ATTEMPT TO DO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-06-07 THE MOUNTAINS UNDERNEATH WHICH THE NOME KING'S EXTENSIVE CAVERNS WERE LOCATED LAY GROUPED JUST NORTH OF THE LAND OF EV WHICH LAY DIRECTLY ACROSS THE DEADLY DESERT TO THE EAST OF THE LAND OF OZ. AS THE MOUNTAINS WERE ALSO ON THE EDGE OF THE DESERT THE NOME KING FOUND THAT HE HAD ONLY TO TUNNEL UNDERNEATH THE DESERT TO REACH OZMA'S DOMINIONS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-06-08 HE DID NOT WISH HIS ARMIES TO APPEAR ABOVE GROUND IN THE COUNTRY OF THE WINKIES WHICH WAS THE PART OF THE LAND OF OZ NEAREST TO KING ROQUAT'S OWN COUNTRY AS THEN THE PEOPLE WOULD GIVE THE ALARM AND ENABLE OZMA TO FORTIFY THE EMERALD CITY AND ASSEMBLE AN ARMY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-06-09 HE WANTED TO TAKE ALL THE OZ PEOPLE BY SURPRISE,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-06-10 SO HE DECIDED TO RUN THE TUNNEL CLEAR THROUGH TO THE EMERALD CITY WHERE HE AND HIS HOSTS COULD BREAK THROUGH THE GROUND WITHOUT WARNING AND CONQUER THE PEOPLE BEFORE THEY HAD TIME TO DEFEND THEMSELVES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-06-11 ROQUAT THE RED BEGAN WORK AT ONCE UPON HIS TUNNEL SETTING A THOUSAND MINERS AT THE TASK AND BUILDING IT HIGH AND BROAD ENOUGH FOR HIS ARMIES TO MARCH THROUGH IT WITH EASE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-06-12 THE NOMES WERE USED TO MAKING TUNNELS AS ALL THE KINGDOM IN WHICH THEY LIVED WAS UNDER GROUND,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-06-13 SO THEY MADE RAPID PROGRESS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-06-14 WHILE THIS WORK WAS GOING ON GENERAL GUPH STARTED OUT ALONE TO VISIT THE CHIEF OF THE WHIMSIES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-06-15 THESE WHIMSIES WERE CURIOUS PEOPLE WHO LIVED IN A RETIRED COUNTRY OF THEIR OWN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-06-16 THEY HAD LARGE STRONG BODIES BUT HEADS SO SMALL THAT THEY WERE NO BIGGER THAN DOOR KNOBS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-06-17 OF COURSE SUCH TINY HEADS COULD NOT CONTAIN ANY GREAT AMOUNT OF BRAINS AND THE WHIMSIES WERE SO ASHAMED OF THEIR PERSONAL APPEARANCE AND LACK OF COMMONSENSE THAT THEY WORE BIG HEADS MADE OF PASTEBOARD WHICH THEY FASTENED OVER THEIR OWN LITTLE HEADS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-06-18 ON THESE PASTEBOARD HEADS THEY SEWED SHEEP'S WOOL FOR HAIR AND THE WOOL WAS COLORED MANY TINTS PINK GREEN AND LAVENDER BEING THE FAVORITE COLORS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-06-19 THE FACES OF THESE FALSE HEADS WERE PAINTED IN MANY RIDICULOUS WAYS ACCORDING TO THE WHIMS OF THE OWNERS AND THESE BIG BURLY CREATURES LOOKED SO WHIMSICAL AND ABSURD IN THEIR QUEER MASKS THAT THEY WERE CALLED WHIMSIES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-06-20 THEY FOOLISHLY IMAGINED THAT NO ONE WOULD SUSPECT THE LITTLE HEADS THAT WERE INSIDE THE IMITATION ONES NOT KNOWING THAT IT IS FOLLY TO TRY TO APPEAR OTHERWISE THAN AS NATURE HAS MADE US.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-06-21 THE CHIEF OF THE WHIMSIES HAD AS LITTLE WISDOM AS THE OTHERS AND HAD BEEN CHOSEN CHIEF MERELY BECAUSE NONE AMONG THEM WAS ANY WISER OR MORE CAPABLE OF RULING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-06-22 THE WHIMSIES WERE EVIL SPIRITS AND COULD NOT BE KILLED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-06-23 THEY WERE HATED AND FEARED BY EVERY ONE AND WERE KNOWN AS TERRIBLE FIGHTERS BECAUSE THEY WERE SO STRONG AND MUSCULAR AND HAD NOT SENSE ENOUGH TO KNOW WHEN THEY WERE DEFEATED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-06-24 GENERAL GUPH THOUGHT THE WHIMSIES WOULD BE A GREAT HELP TO THE NOMES IN THE CONQUEST OF OZ FOR UNDER HIS LEADERSHIP THEY COULD BE INDUCED TO FIGHT AS LONG SO THEY COULD STAND UP.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-06-25 SO HE TRAVELED TO THEIR COUNTRY AND ASKED TO SEE THE CHIEF WHO LIVED IN A HOUSE THAT HAD A PICTURE OF HIS GROTESQUE FALSE HEAD PAINTED OVER THE DOORWAY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-06-26 THE CHIEF'S FALSE HEAD HAD BLUE HAIR A TURNED UP NOSE AND A MOUTH THAT STRETCHED HALF ACROSS THE FACE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-06-27 BIG GREEN EYES HAD BEEN PAINTED UPON IT BUT IN THE CENTER OF THE CHIN WERE TWO SMALL HOLES MADE IN THE PASTEBOARD SO THAT THE CHIEF COULD SEE THROUGH THEM WITH HIS OWN TINY EYES,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-06-28 FOR WHEN THE BIG HEAD WAS FASTENED UPON HIS SHOULDERS THE EYES IN HIS OWN NATURAL HEAD WERE ON A LEVEL WITH THE FALSE CHIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-06-29 SAID GENERAL GUPH TO THE CHIEF OF THE WHIMSIES, WE NOMES ARE GOING TO CONQUER THE LAND OF OZ AND CAPTURE OUR KING'S MAGIC BELT WHICH THE OZ PEOPLE STOLE FROM HIM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-06-30 THEN WE ARE GOING TO PLUNDER AND DESTROY THE WHOLE COUNTRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-06-31 AND WE WANT THE WHIMSIES TO HELP US.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-06-32 WILL THERE BE ANY FIGHTING?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-06-33 ASKED THE CHIEF.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-06-34 PLENTY REPLIED GUPH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-06-35 THAT MUST HAVE PLEASED THE CHIEF FOR HE GOT UP AND DANCED AROUND THE ROOM THREE TIMES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-06-36 THEN HE SEATED HIMSELF AGAIN ADJUSTED HIS FALSE HEAD AND SAID, WE HAVE NO QUARREL WITH OZMA OF OZ. BUT YOU WHIMSIES LOVE TO FIGHT AND HERE IS A SPLENDID CHANCE TO DO SO URGED GUPH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-06-37 WAIT TILL I SING A SONG SAID THE CHIEF.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-06-38 THEN HE LAY BACK IN HIS CHAIR AND SANG A FOOLISH SONG THAT DID NOT SEEM TO THE GENERAL TO MEAN ANYTHING ALTHOUGH HE LISTENED CAREFULLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-06-39 WHEN HE HAD FINISHED THE CHIEF WHIMSIE LOOKED AT HIM THROUGH THE HOLES IN HIS CHIN AND ASKED, WHAT REWARD WILL YOU GIVE US IF WE HELP YOU?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-06-40 THE GENERAL WAS PREPARED FOR THIS QUESTION FOR HE HAD BEEN THINKING THE MATTER OVER ON HIS JOURNEY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-06-41 PEOPLE OFTEN DO A GOOD DEED WITHOUT HOPE OF REWARD BUT FOR AN EVIL DEED THEY ALWAYS DEMAND PAYMENT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-06-42 WHEN WE GET OUR MAGIC BELT HE MADE REPLY OUR KING ROQUAT THE RED WILL USE ITS POWER TO GIVE EVERY WHIMSIE A NATURAL HEAD AS BIG AND FINE AS THE FALSE HEAD HE NOW WEARS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-06-43 THEN YOU WILL NO LONGER BE ASHAMED BECAUSE YOUR BIG STRONG BODIES HAVE SUCH TEENTY WEENTY HEADS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-06-44 OH!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-06-45 WILL YOU DO THAT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-06-46 ASKED THE CHIEF EAGERLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-06-47 WE SURELY WILL PROMISED THE GENERAL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-06-48 I'LL TALK TO MY PEOPLE SAID THE CHIEF.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-06-49 SO HE CALLED A MEETING OF ALL THE WHIMSIES AND TOLD THEM OF THE OFFER MADE BY THE NOMES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-06-50 THE CREATURES WERE DELIGHTED WITH THE BARGAIN AND AT ONCE AGREED TO FIGHT FOR THE NOME KING AND HELP HIM TO CONQUER OZ. ONE WHIMSIE ALONE SEEMED TO HAVE A GLIMMER OF SENSE FOR HE ASKED, SUPPOSE WE FAIL TO CAPTURE THE MAGIC BELT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-06-51 WHAT WILL HAPPEN THEN AND WHAT GOOD WILL ALL OUR FIGHTING DO?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-06-52 BUT THEY THREW HIM INTO THE RIVER FOR ASKING FOOLISH QUESTIONS AND LAUGHED WHEN THE WATER RUINED HIS PASTEBOARD HEAD BEFORE HE COULD SWIM OUT AGAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-06-53 SO THE COMPACT WAS MADE AND GENERAL GUPH WAS DELIGHTED WITH HIS SUCCESS IN GAINING SUCH POWERFUL ALLIES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-06-54 BUT THERE WERE OTHER PEOPLE TOO JUST AS IMPORTANT AS THE WHIMSIES WHOM THE CLEVER OLD NOME HAD DETERMINED TO WIN TO HIS SIDE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-01 CHAPTER SEVEN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-02 HOW AUNT EM CONQUERED THE LION THESE ARE YOUR ROOMS SAID DOROTHY OPENING A DOOR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-03 AUNT EM DREW BACK AT THE SIGHT OF THE SPLENDID FURNITURE AND DRAPERIES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-04 AIN'T THERE ANY PLACE TO WIPE MY FEET?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-05 SHE ASKED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-06 YOU WILL SOON CHANGE YOUR SLIPPERS FOR NEW SHOES REPLIED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-07 DON'T BE AFRAID AUNT EM. HERE IS WHERE YOU ARE TO LIVE SO WALK RIGHT IN AND MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-08 AUNT EM ADVANCED HESITATINGLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-09 IT BEATS THE TOPEKA HOTEL!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-10 SHE CRIED ADMIRINGLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-11 BUT THIS PLACE IS TOO GRAND FOR US CHILD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-12 CAN'T WE HAVE SOME BACK ROOM IN THE ATTIC THAT'S MORE IN OUR CLASS?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-13 NO SAID DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-14 YOU'VE GOT TO LIVE HERE CAUSE OZMA SAYS SO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-15 AND ALL THE ROOMS IN THIS PALACE ARE JUST AS FINE AS THESE AND SOME ARE BETTER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-16 IT WON'T DO ANY GOOD TO FUSS AUNT EM. YOU'VE GOT TO BE SWELL AND HIGH TONED IN THE LAND OF OZ WHETHER YOU WANT TO OR NOT,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-17 SO YOU MAY AS WELL MAKE UP YOUR MIND TO IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-18 IT'S HARD LUCK REPLIED HER AUNT LOOKING AROUND WITH AN AWED EXPRESSION,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-19 BUT FOLKS CAN GET USED TO ANYTHING IF THEY TRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-20 EH HENRY?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-21 WHY AS TO THAT SAID UNCLE HENRY SLOWLY I B'LIEVE IN TAKIN WHAT'S PERVIDED US AN ASKIN NO QUESTIONS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-22 I'VE TRAVELED SOME EM IN MY TIME AND YOU HAIN'T,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-23 AN THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE ATWEEN US.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-24 THEN DOROTHY SHOWED THEM THROUGH THE ROOMS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-25 THE FIRST WAS A HANDSOME SITTING ROOM WITH WINDOWS OPENING UPON THE ROSE GARDENS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-26 THEN CAME SEPARATE BEDROOMS FOR AUNT EM AND UNCLE HENRY WITH A FINE BATHROOM BETWEEN THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-27 AUNT EM HAD A PRETTY DRESSING ROOM BESIDES AND DOROTHY OPENED THE CLOSETS AND SHOWED SEVERAL EXQUISITE COSTUMES THAT HAD BEEN PROVIDED FOR HER AUNT BY THE ROYAL DRESSMAKERS WHO HAD WORKED ALL NIGHT TO GET THEM READY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-28 EVERYTHING THAT AUNT EM COULD POSSIBLY NEED WAS IN THE DRAWERS AND CLOSETS AND HER DRESSING TABLE WAS COVERED WITH ENGRAVED GOLD TOILET ARTICLES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-29 UNCLE HENRY HAD NINE SUITS OF CLOTHES CUT IN THE POPULAR MUNCHKIN FASHION WITH KNEE BREECHES SILK STOCKINGS AND LOW SHOES WITH JEWELED BUCKLES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-30 THE HATS TO MATCH THESE COSTUMES HAD POINTED TOPS AND WIDE BRIMS WITH SMALL GOLD BELLS AROUND THE EDGES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-31 HIS SHIRTS WERE OF FINE LINEN WITH FRILLED BOSOMS AND HIS VESTS WERE RICHLY EMBROIDERED WITH COLORED SILKS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-32 UNCLE HENRY DECIDED THAT HE WOULD FIRST TAKE A BATH AND THEN DRESS HIMSELF IN A BLUE SATIN SUIT THAT HAD CAUGHT HIS FANCY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-33 HE ACCEPTED HIS GOOD FORTUNE WITH CALM COMPOSURE AND REFUSED TO HAVE A SERVANT TO ASSIST HIM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-34 BUT AUNT EM WAS ALL OF A FLUTTER AS SHE SAID AND IT TOOK DOROTHY AND JELLIA JAMB THE HOUSEKEEPER AND TWO MAIDS A LONG TIME TO DRESS HER AND DO UP HER HAIR AND GET HER RIGGED LIKE A POPINJAY AS SHE QUAINTLY EXPRESSED IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-35 SHE WANTED TO STOP AND ADMIRE EVERYTHING THAT CAUGHT HER EYE AND SHE SIGHED CONTINUALLY AND DECLARED THAT SUCH FINERY WAS TOO GOOD FOR AN OLD COUNTRY WOMAN AND THAT SHE NEVER THOUGHT SHE WOULD HAVE TO PUT ON AIRS AT HER TIME OF LIFE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-36 FINALLY SHE WAS DRESSED AND WHEN SHE WENT INTO THE SITTING ROOM THERE WAS UNCLE HENRY IN HIS BLUE SATIN WALKING GRAVELY UP AND DOWN THE ROOM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-37 HE HAD TRIMMED HIS BEARD AND MUSTACHE AND LOOKED VERY DIGNIFIED AND RESPECTABLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-38 TELL ME DOROTHY HE SAID,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-39 DO ALL THE MEN HERE WEAR DUDS LIKE THESE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-40 YES SHE REPLIED,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-41 ALL CEPT THE SCARECROW AND THE SHAGGY MAN AND OF COURSE THE TIN WOODMAN AND TIKTOK WHO ARE MADE OF METAL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-42 YOU'LL FIND ALL THE MEN AT OZMA'S COURT DRESSED JUST AS YOU ARE ONLY PERHAPS A LITTLE FINER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-43 HENRY YOU LOOK LIKE A PLAY ACTOR ANNOUNCED AUNT EM LOOKING AT HER HUSBAND CRITICALLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-44 AN YOU EM LOOK MORE HIGHFALUTIN THAN A PEACOCK HE REPLIED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-45 I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT SHE SAID REGRETFULLY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-46 BUT WE'RE HELPLESS VICTIMS OF HIGH TONED ROYALTY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-47 DOROTHY WAS MUCH AMUSED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-48 COME WITH ME SHE SAID AND I'LL SHOW YOU ROUND THE PALACE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-49 SHE TOOK THEM THROUGH THE BEAUTIFUL ROOMS AND INTRODUCED THEM TO ALL THE PEOPLE THEY CHANCED TO MEET.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-50 ALSO SHE SHOWED THEM HER OWN PRETTY ROOMS WHICH WERE NOT FAR FROM THEIR OWN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-51 SO IT'S ALL TRUE SAID AUNT EM WIDE EYED WITH AMAZEMENT AND WHAT DOROTHY TOLD US OF THIS FAIRY COUNTRY WAS PLAIN FACTS INSTEAD OF DREAMS!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-52 BUT WHERE ARE ALL THE STRANGE CREATURES YOU USED TO KNOW HERE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-53 YES WHERE'S THE SCARECROW?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-54 INQUIRED UNCLE HENRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-55 WHY HE'S JUST NOW AWAY ON A VISIT TO THE TIN WOODMAN WHO IS EMP'ROR OF THE WINKIE COUNTRY ANSWERED THE LITTLE GIRL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-56 YOU'LL SEE HIM WHEN HE COMES BACK AND YOU'RE SURE TO LIKE HIM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-57 AND WHERE'S THE WONDERFUL WIZARD?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-58 ASKED AUNT EM. YOU'LL SEE HIM AT OZMA'S LUNCHEON FOR HE LIVES HERE IN THIS PALACE WAS THE REPLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-59 AND JACK PUMPKINHEAD?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-60 OH HE LIVES A LITTLE WAY OUT OF TOWN IN HIS OWN PUMPKIN FIELD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-61 WE'LL GO THERE SOME TIME AND SEE HIM AND WE'LL CALL ON PROFESSOR WOGGLEBUG TOO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-62 THE SHAGGY MAN WILL BE AT THE LUNCHEON I GUESS AND TIKTOK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-63 AND NOW I'LL TAKE YOU OUT TO SEE BILLINA WHO HAS A HOUSE OF HER OWN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-64 SO THEY WENT INTO THE BACK YARD AND AFTER WALKING ALONG WINDING PATHS SOME DISTANCE THROUGH THE BEAUTIFUL GARDENS THEY CAME TO AN ATTRACTIVE LITTLE HOUSE WHERE THE YELLOW HEN SAT ON THE FRONT PORCH SUNNING HERSELF.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-65 GOOD MORNING MY DEAR MISTRESS CALLED BILLINA FLUTTERING DOWN TO MEET THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-66 I WAS EXPECTING YOU TO CALL FOR I HEARD YOU HAD COME BACK AND BROUGHT YOUR UNCLE AND AUNT WITH YOU.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-67 WE'RE HERE FOR GOOD AND ALL THIS TIME BILLINA CRIED DOROTHY JOYFULLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-68 UNCLE HENRY AND AUNT EM BELONG TO OZ NOW AS MUCH AS I DO!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-69 THEN THEY ARE VERY LUCKY PEOPLE DECLARED BILLINA,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-70 FOR THERE COULDN'T BE A NICER PLACE TO LIVE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-71 BUT COME MY DEAR,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-72 I MUST SHOW YOU ALL MY DOROTHYS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-73 NINE ARE LIVING AND HAVE GROWN UP TO BE VERY RESPECTABLE HENS,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-74 BUT ONE TOOK COLD AT OZMA'S BIRTHDAY PARTY AND DIED OF THE PIP AND THE OTHER TWO TURNED OUT TO BE HORRID ROOSTERS SO I HAD TO CHANGE THEIR NAMES FROM DOROTHY TO DANIEL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-75 THEY ALL HAD THE LETTER D ENGRAVED UPON THEIR GOLD LOCKETS YOU REMEMBER WITH YOUR PICTURE INSIDE AND D STANDS FOR DANIEL AS WELL AS FOR DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-76 DID YOU CALL BOTH THE ROOSTERS DANIEL?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-77 ASKED UNCLE HENRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-78 YES INDEED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-79 I'VE NINE DOROTHYS AND TWO DANIELS,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-80 AND THE NINE DOROTHYS HAVE EIGHTY SIX SONS AND DAUGHTERS AND OVER THREE HUNDRED GRANDCHILDREN SAID BILLINA PROUDLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-81 WHAT NAMES DO YOU GIVE EM ALL DEAR?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-82 INQUIRED THE LITTLE GIRL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-83 OH THEY ARE ALL DOROTHYS AND DANIELS SOME BEING JUNIORS AND SOME DOUBLE JUNIORS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-84 DOROTHY AND DANIEL ARE TWO GOOD NAMES AND I SEE NO OBJECT IN HUNTING FOR OTHERS DECLARED THE YELLOW HEN. BUT JUST THINK DOROTHY WHAT A BIG CHICKEN FAMILY WE'VE GROWN TO BE AND OUR NUMBERS INCREASE NEARLY EVERY DAY!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-85 OZMA DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH ALL THE EGGS WE LAY AND WE ARE NEVER EATEN OR HARMED IN ANY WAY AS CHICKENS ARE IN YOUR COUNTRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-86 THEY GIVE US EVERYTHING TO MAKE US CONTENTED AND HAPPY AND I MY DEAR AM THE ACKNOWLEDGED QUEEN AND GOVERNOR OF EVERY CHICKEN IN OZ BECAUSE I'M THE ELDEST AND STARTED THE WHOLE COLONY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-87 YOU OUGHT TO BE VERY PROUD MA'AM SAID UNCLE HENRY WHO WAS ASTONISHED TO HEAR A HEN TALK SO SENSIBLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-88 OH I AM SHE REPLIED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-89 I'VE THE LOVELIEST PEARL NECKLACE YOU EVER SAW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-90 COME IN THE HOUSE AND I'LL SHOW IT TO YOU.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-91 AND I'VE NINE LEG BRACELETS AND A DIAMOND PIN FOR EACH WING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-92 BUT I ONLY WEAR THEM ON STATE OCCASIONS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-93 THEY FOLLOWED THE YELLOW HEN INTO THE HOUSE WHICH AUNT EM DECLARED WAS NEAT AS A PIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-94 THEY COULD NOT SIT DOWN BECAUSE ALL BILLINA'S CHAIRS WERE ROOSTING POLES MADE OF SILVER,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-95 SO THEY HAD TO STAND WHILE THE HEN FUSSILY SHOWED THEM HER TREASURES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-96 THEN THEY HAD TO GO INTO THE BACK ROOMS OCCUPIED BY BILLINA'S NINE DOROTHYS AND TWO DANIELS WHO WERE ALL PLUMP YELLOW CHICKENS AND GREETED THE VISITORS VERY POLITELY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-97 IT WAS EASY TO SEE THAT THEY WERE WELL BRED AND THAT BILLINA HAD LOOKED AFTER THEIR EDUCATION.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-98 IN THE YARDS WERE ALL THE CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN OF THESE ELEVEN ELDERS AND THEY WERE OF ALL SIZES FROM WELL GROWN HENS TO TINY CHICKENS JUST OUT OF THE SHELL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-99 ABOUT FIFTY FLUFFY YELLOW YOUNGSTERS WERE AT SCHOOL BEING TAUGHT GOOD MANNERS AND GOOD GRAMMAR BY A YOUNG HEN WHO WORE SPECTACLES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-100 THEY SANG IN CHORUS A PATRIOTIC SONG OF THE LAND OF OZ IN HONOR OF THEIR VISITORS AND AUNT EM WAS MUCH IMPRESSED BY THESE TALKING CHICKENS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-101 DOROTHY WANTED TO STAY AND PLAY WITH THE YOUNG CHICKENS FOR AWHILE BUT UNCLE HENRY AND AUNT EM HAD NOT SEEN THE PALACE GROUNDS AND GARDENS YET AND WERE EAGER TO GET BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH THE MARVELOUS AND DELIGHTFUL LAND IN WHICH THEY WERE TO LIVE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-102 I'LL STAY HERE AND YOU CAN GO FOR A WALK SAID DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-103 YOU'LL BE PERFEC'LY SAFE ANYWHERE AND MAY DO WHATEVER YOU WANT TO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-104 WHEN YOU GET TIRED GO BACK TO THE PALACE AND FIND YOUR ROOMS AND I'LL COME TO YOU BEFORE LUNCHEON IS READY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-105 SO UNCLE HENRY AND AUNT EM STARTED OUT ALONE TO EXPLORE THE GROUNDS AND DOROTHY KNEW THAT THEY COULDN'T GET LOST BECAUSE ALL THE PALACE GROUNDS WERE ENCLOSED BY A HIGH WALL OF GREEN MARBLE SET WITH EMERALDS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-106 IT WAS A RARE TREAT TO THESE SIMPLE FOLK WHO HAD LIVED IN THE COUNTRY ALL THEIR LIVES AND KNOWN LITTLE ENJOYMENT OF ANY SORT TO WEAR BEAUTIFUL CLOTHES AND LIVE IN A PALACE AND BE TREATED WITH RESPECT AND CONSIDERATION BY ALL AROUND THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-107 THEY WERE VERY HAPPY INDEED AS THEY STROLLED UP THE SHADY WALKS AND LOOKED UPON THE GORGEOUS FLOWERS AND SHRUBS FEELING THAT THEIR NEW HOME WAS MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN ANY TONGUE COULD DESCRIBE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-108 SUDDENLY AS THEY TURNED A CORNER AND WALKED THROUGH A GAP IN A HIGH HEDGE THEY CAME FACE TO FACE WITH AN ENORMOUS LION WHICH CROUCHED UPON THE GREEN LAWN AND SEEMED SURPRISED BY THEIR APPEARANCE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-109 THEY STOPPED SHORT UNCLE HENRY TREMBLING WITH HORROR AND AUNT EM TOO TERRIFIED TO SCREAM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-110 NEXT MOMENT THE POOR WOMAN CLASPED HER HUSBAND AROUND THE NECK AND CRIED, SAVE ME HENRY SAVE ME!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-111 CAN'T EVEN SAVE MYSELF EM HE RETURNED IN A HUSKY VOICE FOR THE ANIMILE LOOKS AS IF IT COULD EAT BOTH OF US AN LICK ITS CHOPS FOR MORE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-112 IF I ONLY HAD A GUN HAVEN'T YOU HENRY?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-113 HAVEN'T YOU?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-114 SHE ASKED ANXIOUSLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-115 NARY GUN EM. SO LET'S DIE AS BRAVE AN GRACEFUL AS WE CAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-116 I KNEW OUR LUCK COULDN'T LAST!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-117 I WON'T DIE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-118 I WON'T BE EATEN BY A LION!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-119 AUNT EM GLARING UPON THE HUGE BEAST.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-120 THEN A THOUGHT STRUCK HER AND SHE WHISPERED HENRY I'VE HEARD AS SAVAGE BEASTSES CAN BE CONQUERED BY THE HUMAN EYE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-121 I'LL EYE THAT LION OUT O COUNTENANCE AN SAVE OUR LIVES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-122 TRY IT EM HE RETURNED ALSO IN A WHISPER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-123 LOOK AT HIM AS YOU DO AT ME WHEN I'M LATE TO DINNER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-124 SHE GLARED AT THE IMMENSE BEAST STEADILY AND THE LION WHO HAD BEEN QUIETLY BLINKING AT THEM BEGAN TO APPEAR UNEASY AND DISTURBED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-125 IS ANYTHING THE MATTER MA'AM?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-126 HE ASKED IN A MILD VOICE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-127 AT THIS SPEECH FROM THE TERRIBLE BEAST AUNT EM AND UNCLE HENRY BOTH WERE STARTLED AND THEN UNCLE HENRY REMEMBERED THAT THIS MUST BE THE LION THEY HAD SEEN IN OZMA'S THRONE ROOM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-128 HOLD ON EM!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-129 EXCLAIMED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-130 QUIT THE EAGLE EYE CONQUEST AN TAKE COURAGE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-131 I GUESS THIS IS THE SAME COWARDLY LION DOROTHY HAS TOLD US ABOUT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-132 OH IS IT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-133 SHE CRIED MUCH RELIEVED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-134 WHEN HE SPOKE I GOT THE IDEA,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-135 AND WHEN HE LOOKED SO SHAMED LIKE I WAS SURE OF IT UNCLE HENRY CONTINUED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-136 AUNT EM REGARDED THE ANIMAL WITH NEW INTEREST.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-137 ARE YOU THE COWARDLY LION?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-138 SHE INQUIRED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-139 ARE YOU DOROTHY'S FRIEND?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-140 YES'M ANSWERED THE LION MEEKLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-141 DOROTHY AND I ARE OLD CHUMS AND ARE VERY FOND OF EACH OTHER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-142 I'M THE KING OF BEASTS YOU KNOW AND THE HUNGRY TIGER AND I SERVE PRINCESS OZMA AS HER BODY GUARDS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-143 TO BE SURE SAID AUNT EM NODDING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-144 BUT THE KING OF BEASTS SHOULDN'T BE COWARDLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-145 I'VE HEARD THAT SAID BEFORE REMARKED THE LION YAWNING TILL HE SHOWED TWO GREAT ROWS OF SHARP WHITE TEETH,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-146 BUT THAT DOES NOT KEEP ME FROM BEING FRIGHTENED WHENEVER I GO INTO BATTLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-147 WHAT DO YOU DO RUN?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-148 ASKED UNCLE HENRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-149 NO,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-150 THAT WOULD BE FOOLISH FOR THE ENEMY WOULD RUN AFTER ME DECLARED THE LION.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-151 SO I TREMBLE WITH FEAR AND PITCH IN AS HARD AS I CAN,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-152 AND SO FAR I HAVE ALWAYS WON MY FIGHT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-153 AH I BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND SAID UNCLE HENRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-154 WERE YOU SCARED WHEN I LOOKED AT YOU JUST NOW?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-155 INQUIRED AUNT EM. TERRIBLY SCARED MADAM ANSWERED THE LION FOR AT FIRST I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO HAVE A FIT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-156 THEN I NOTICED YOU WERE TRYING TO OVERCOME ME BY THE POWER OF YOUR EYE AND YOUR GLANCE WAS SO FIERCE AND PENETRATING THAT I SHOOK WITH FEAR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-157 THIS GREATLY PLEASED THE LADY AND SHE SAID QUITE CHEERFULLY, WELL I WON'T HURT YOU SO DON'T BE SCARED ANY MORE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-158 I JUST WANTED TO SEE WHAT THE HUMAN EYE WAS GOOD FOR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-159 THE HUMAN EYE IS A FEARFUL WEAPON REMARKED THE LION SCRATCHING HIS NOSE SOFTLY WITH HIS PAW TO HIDE A SMILE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-160 HAD I NOT KNOWN YOU WERE DOROTHY'S FRIENDS I MIGHT HAVE TORN YOU BOTH INTO SHREDS IN ORDER TO ESCAPE YOUR TERRIBLE GAZE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-161 AUNT EM SHUDDERED AT HEARING THIS AND UNCLE HENRY SAID HASTILY, I'M GLAD YOU KNEW US.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-162 GOOD MORNING MISTER LION,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-163 WE'LL HOPE TO SEE YOU AGAIN BY AND BY SOME TIME IN THE FUTURE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-164 GOOD MORNING REPLIED THE LION SQUATTING DOWN UPON THE LAWN AGAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-07-165 YOU ARE LIKELY TO SEE A GOOD DEAL OF ME IF YOU LIVE IN THE LAND OF OZ.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-01 CHAPTER EIGHT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-02 HOW THE GRAND GALLIPOOT JOINED THE NOMES AFTER LEAVING THE WHIMSIES GUPH CONTINUED ON HIS JOURNEY AND PENETRATED FAR INTO THE NORTHWEST.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-03 HE WANTED TO GET TO THE COUNTRY OF THE GROWLEYWOGS AND IN ORDER TO DO THAT HE MUST CROSS THE RIPPLE LAND WHICH WAS A HARD THING TO DO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-04 FOR THE RIPPLE LAND WAS A SUCCESSION OF HILLS AND VALLEYS ALL VERY STEEP AND ROCKY AND THEY CHANGED PLACES CONSTANTLY BY RIPPLING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-05 WHILE GUPH WAS CLIMBING A HILL IT SANK DOWN UNDER HIM AND BECAME A VALLEY AND WHILE HE WAS DESCENDING INTO A VALLEY IT ROSE UP AND CARRIED HIM TO THE TOP OF A HILL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-06 THIS WAS VERY PERPLEXING TO THE TRAVELER AND A STRANGER MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT HE COULD NEVER CROSS THE RIPPLE LAND AT ALL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-07 BUT GUPH KNEW THAT IF HE KEPT STEADILY ON HE WOULD GET TO THE END AT LAST,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-08 SO HE PAID NO ATTENTION TO THE CHANGING HILLS AND VALLEYS AND PLODDED ALONG AS CALMLY AS IF WALKING UPON THE LEVEL GROUND.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-09 THE RESULT OF THIS WISE PERSISTENCE WAS THAT THE GENERAL FINALLY REACHED FIRMER SOIL AND AFTER PENETRATING A DENSE FOREST CAME TO THE DOMINION OF THE GROWLEYWOGS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-10 NO SOONER HAD HE CROSSED THE BORDER OF THIS DOMAIN WHEN TWO GUARDS SEIZED HIM AND CARRIED HIM BEFORE THE GRAND GALLIPOOT OF THE GROWLEYWOGS WHO SCOWLED UPON HIM FEROCIOUSLY AND ASKED HIM WHY HE DARED INTRUDE UPON HIS TERRITORY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-11 I'M THE LORD HIGH GENERAL OF THE INVINCIBLE ARMY OF THE NOMES AND MY NAME IS GUPH WAS THE REPLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-12 ALL THE WORLD TREMBLES WHEN THAT NAME IS MENTIONED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-13 THE GROWLEYWOGS GAVE A SHOUT OF JEERING LAUGHTER AT THIS AND ONE OF THEM CAUGHT THE NOME IN HIS STRONG ARMS AND TOSSED HIM HIGH INTO THE AIR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-14 GUPH WAS CONSIDERABLY SHAKEN WHEN HE FELL UPON THE HARD GROUND BUT HE APPEARED TO TAKE NO NOTICE OF THE IMPERTINENCE AND COMPOSED HIMSELF TO SPEAK AGAIN TO THE GRAND GALLIPOOT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-15 MY MASTER KING ROQUAT THE RED HAS SENT ME HERE TO CONFER WITH YOU.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-16 HE WISHES YOUR ASSISTANCE TO CONQUER THE LAND OF OZ. HERE THE GENERAL PAUSED AND THE GRAND GALLIPOOT SCOWLED UPON HIM MORE TERRIBLY THAN EVER AND SAID, GO ON!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-17 THE VOICE OF THE GRAND GALLIPOOT WAS PARTLY A ROAR AND PARTLY A GROWL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-18 HE MUMBLED HIS WORDS BADLY AND GUPH HAD TO LISTEN CAREFULLY IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND HIM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-19 THESE GROWLEYWOGS WERE CERTAINLY REMARKABLE CREATURES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-20 THEY WERE OF GIGANTIC SIZE YET WERE ALL BONE AND SKIN AND MUSCLE THERE BEING NO MEAT OR FAT UPON THEIR BODIES AT ALL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-21 THEIR POWERFUL MUSCLES LAY JUST UNDERNEATH THEIR SKINS LIKE BUNCHES OF TOUGH ROPE AND THE WEAKEST GROWLEYWOG WAS SO STRONG THAT HE COULD PICK UP AN ELEPHANT AND TOSS IT SEVEN MILES AWAY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-22 IT SEEMS UNFORTUNATE THAT STRONG PEOPLE ARE USUALLY SO DISAGREEABLE AND OVERBEARING THAT NO ONE CARES FOR THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-23 IN FACT TO BE DIFFERENT FROM YOUR FELLOW CREATURES IS ALWAYS A MISFORTUNE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-24 THE GROWLEYWOGS KNEW THAT THEY WERE DISLIKED AND AVOIDED BY EVERY ONE SO THEY HAD BECOME SURLY AND UNSOCIABLE EVEN AMONG THEMSELVES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-25 GUPH KNEW THAT THEY HATED ALL PEOPLE INCLUDING THE NOMES,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-26 BUT HE HOPED TO WIN THEM OVER NEVERTHELESS AND KNEW THAT IF HE SUCCEEDED THEY WOULD AFFORD HIM VERY POWERFUL ASSISTANCE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-27 THE LAND OF OZ IS RULED BY A NAMBY PAMBY GIRL WHO IS DISGUSTINGLY KIND AND GOOD HE CONTINUED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-28 HER PEOPLE ARE ALL HAPPY AND CONTENTED AND HAVE NO CARE OR WORRIES WHATEVER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-29 GO ON!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-30 GROWLED THE GRAND GALLIPOOT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-31 ONCE THE NOME KING ENSLAVED THE ROYAL FAMILY OF EV ANOTHER GOODY GOODY LOT THAT WE DETEST SAID THE GENERAL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-32 BUT OZMA INTERFERED ALTHOUGH IT WAS NONE OF HER BUSINESS AND MARCHED HER ARMY AGAINST US.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-33 WITH HER WAS A KANSAS GIRL NAMED DOROTHY AND A YELLOW HEN AND THEY MARCHED DIRECTLY INTO THE NOME KING'S CAVERN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-34 THERE THEY LIBERATED OUR SLAVES FROM EV AND STOLE KING ROQUAT'S MAGIC BELT WHICH THEY CARRIED AWAY WITH THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-35 SO NOW OUR KING IS MAKING A TUNNEL UNDER THE DEADLY DESERT SO WE CAN MARCH THROUGH IT TO THE EMERALD CITY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-36 WHEN WE GET THERE WE MEAN TO CONQUER AND DESTROY ALL THE LAND AND RECAPTURE THE MAGIC BELT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-37 AGAIN HE PAUSED AND AGAIN THE GRAND GALLIPOOT GROWLED, GO ON!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-38 GUPH TRIED TO THINK WHAT TO SAY NEXT AND A HAPPY THOUGHT SOON OCCURRED TO HIM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-39 WE WANT YOU TO HELP US IN THIS CONQUEST HE ANNOUNCED FOR WE NEED THE MIGHTY AID OF THE GROWLEYWOGS IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT WE SHALL NOT BE DEFEATED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-40 YOU ARE THE STRONGEST PEOPLE IN ALL THE WORLD AND YOU HATE GOOD AND HAPPY CREATURES AS MUCH AS WE NOMES DO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-41 I AM SURE IT WILL BE A REAL PLEASURE TO YOU TO TEAR DOWN THE BEAUTIFUL EMERALD CITY AND IN RETURN FOR YOUR VALUABLE ASSISTANCE WE WILL ALLOW YOU TO BRING BACK TO YOUR COUNTRY TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE OF OZ TO BE YOUR SLAVES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-42 TWENTY THOUSAND!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-43 GROWLED THE GRAND GALLIPOOT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-44 ALL RIGHT WE PROMISE YOU TWENTY THOUSAND AGREED THE GENERAL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-45 THE GALLIPOOT MADE A SIGNAL AND AT ONCE HIS ATTENDANTS PICKED UP GENERAL GUPH AND CARRIED HIM AWAY TO A PRISON WHERE THE JAILER AMUSED HIMSELF BY STICKING PINS IN THE ROUND FAT BODY OF THE OLD NOME TO SEE HIM JUMP AND HEAR HIM YELL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-46 BUT WHILE THIS WAS GOING ON THE GRAND GALLIPOOT WAS TALKING WITH HIS COUNSELORS WHO WERE THE MOST IMPORTANT OFFICIALS OF THE GROWLEYWOGS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-47 WHEN HE HAD STATED TO THEM THE PROPOSITION OF THE NOME KING HE SAID, MY ADVICE IS TO OFFER TO HELP THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-48 THEN WHEN WE HAVE CONQUERED THE LAND OF OZ WE WILL TAKE NOT ONLY OUR TWENTY THOUSAND PRISONERS BUT ALL THE GOLD AND JEWELS WE WANT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-49 LET US TAKE THE MAGIC BELT TOO SUGGESTED ONE COUNSELOR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-50 AND ROB THE NOME KING AND MAKE HIM OUR SLAVE SAID ANOTHER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-51 THAT IS A GOOD IDEA DECLARED THE GRAND GALLIPOOT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-52 I'D LIKE KING ROQUAT FOR MY OWN SLAVE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-53 HE COULD BLACK MY BOOTS AND BRING ME MY PORRIDGE EVERY MORNING WHILE I AM IN BED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-54 THERE IS A FAMOUS SCARECROW IN OZ. I'LL TAKE HIM FOR MY SLAVE SAID A COUNSELOR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-55 I'LL TAKE TIKTOK THE MACHINE MAN SAID ANOTHER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-56 GIVE ME THE TIN WOODMAN SAID A THIRD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-57 THEY WENT ON FOR SOME TIME DIVIDING UP THE PEOPLE AND THE TREASURE OF OZ IN ADVANCE OF THE CONQUEST.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-58 FOR THEY HAD NO DOUBT AT ALL THAT THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO DESTROY OZMA'S DOMAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-59 WERE THEY NOT THE STRONGEST PEOPLE IN ALL THE WORLD?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-60 THE DEADLY DESERT HAS KEPT US OUT OF OZ BEFORE REMARKED THE GRAND GALLIPOOT BUT NOW THAT THE NOME KING IS BUILDING A TUNNEL WE SHALL GET INTO THE EMERALD CITY VERY EASILY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-61 SO LET US SEND THE LITTLE FAT GENERAL BACK TO HIS KING WITH OUR PROMISE TO ASSIST HIM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-62 WE WILL NOT SAY THAT WE INTEND TO CONQUER THE NOMES AFTER WE HAVE CONQUERED OZ BUT WE WILL DO SO JUST THE SAME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-63 THIS PLAN BEING AGREED UPON THEY ALL WENT HOME TO DINNER LEAVING GENERAL GUPH STILL IN PRISON.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-64 THE NOME HAD NO IDEA THAT HE HAD SUCCEEDED IN HIS MISSION FOR FINDING HIMSELF IN PRISON HE FEARED THE GROWLEYWOGS INTENDED TO PUT HIM TO DEATH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-65 BY THIS TIME THE JAILER HAD TIRED OF STICKING PINS IN THE GENERAL AND WAS AMUSING HIMSELF BY CAREFULLY PULLING THE NOME'S WHISKERS OUT BY THE ROOTS ONE AT A TIME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-66 THIS ENJOYMENT WAS INTERRUPTED BY THE GRAND GALLIPOOT SENDING FOR THE PRISONER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-67 WAIT A FEW HOURS BEGGED THE JAILER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-68 I HAVEN'T PULLED OUT A QUARTER OF HIS WHISKERS YET.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-69 IF YOU KEEP THE GRAND GALLIPOOT WAITING HE'LL BREAK YOUR BACK DECLARED THE MESSENGER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-70 PERHAPS YOU'RE RIGHT SIGHED THE JAILER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-71 TAKE THE PRISONER AWAY IF YOU WILL BUT I ADVISE YOU TO KICK HIM AT EVERY STEP HE TAKES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-72 IT WILL BE GOOD FUN FOR HE IS AS SOFT AS A RIPE PEACH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-73 SO GUPH WAS LED AWAY TO THE ROYAL CASTLE WHERE THE GRAND GALLIPOOT TOLD HIM THAT THE GROWLEYWOGS HAD DECIDED TO ASSIST THE NOMES IN CONQUERING THE LAND OF OZ. WHENEVER YOU ARE READY HE ADDED SEND ME WORD AND I WILL MARCH WITH EIGHTEEN THOUSAND OF MY MOST POWERFUL WARRIORS TO YOUR AID.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-74 GUPH WAS SO DELIGHTED THAT HE FORGOT ALL THE SMARTING CAUSED BY THE PINS AND THE PULLING OF WHISKERS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-75 HE DID NOT EVEN COMPLAIN OF THE TREATMENT HE HAD RECEIVED BUT THANKED THE GRAND GALLIPOOT AND HURRIED AWAY UPON HIS JOURNEY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-76 HE HAD NOW SECURED THE ASSISTANCE OF THE WHIMSIES AND THE GROWLEYWOGS,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-77 BUT HIS SUCCESS MADE HIM LONG FOR STILL MORE ALLIES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-78 HIS OWN LIFE DEPENDED UPON HIS CONQUERING OZ AND HE SAID TO HIMSELF, I'LL TAKE NO CHANCES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-79 I'LL BE CERTAIN OF SUCCESS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-80 THEN WHEN OZ IS DESTROYED PERHAPS I SHALL BE A GREATER MAN THAN OLD ROQUAT AND I CAN THROW HIM AWAY AND BE KING OF THE NOMES MYSELF.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-81 WHY NOT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-82 THE WHIMSIES ARE STRONGER THAN THE NOMES AND THEY ALSO ARE MY FRIENDS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-08-83 THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE STILL STRONGER THAN THE GROWLEYWOGS AND IF I CAN BUT INDUCE THEM TO AID ME I SHALL HAVE NOTHING MORE TO FEAR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-01 CHAPTER NINE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-02 HOW THE WOGGLEBUG TAUGHT ATHLETICS IT DID NOT TAKE DOROTHY LONG TO ESTABLISH HERSELF IN HER NEW HOME FOR SHE KNEW THE PEOPLE AND THE MANNERS AND CUSTOMS OF THE EMERALD CITY JUST AS WELL AS SHE KNEW THE OLD KANSAS FARM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-03 BUT UNCLE HENRY AND AUNT EM HAD SOME TROUBLE IN GETTING USED TO THE FINERY AND POMP AND CEREMONY OF OZMA'S PALACE AND FELT UNEASY BECAUSE THEY WERE OBLIGED TO BE DRESSED UP ALL THE TIME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-04 YET EVERY ONE WAS VERY COURTEOUS AND KIND TO THEM AND ENDEAVORED TO MAKE THEM HAPPY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-05 OZMA ESPECIALLY MADE MUCH OF DOROTHY'S RELATIVES FOR HER LITTLE FRIEND'S SAKE AND SHE WELL KNEW THAT THE AWKWARDNESS AND STRANGENESS OF THEIR NEW MODE OF LIFE WOULD ALL WEAR OFF IN TIME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-06 THE OLD PEOPLE WERE CHIEFLY TROUBLED BY THE FACT THAT THERE WAS NO WORK FOR THEM TO DO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-07 EV'RY DAY IS LIKE SUNDAY NOW DECLARED AUNT EM SOLEMNLY AND I CAN'T SAY I LIKE IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-08 IF THEY'D ONLY LET ME DO UP THE DISHES AFTER MEALS OR EVEN SWEEP AN DUST MY OWN ROOMS I'D BE A DEAL HAPPIER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-09 HENRY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH HIMSELF EITHER AND ONCE WHEN HE STOLE OUT AN FED THE CHICKENS BILLINA SCOLDED HIM FOR LETTING EM EAT BETWEEN MEALS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-10 I NEVER KNEW BEFORE WHAT A HARDSHIP IT IS TO BE RICH AND HAVE EVERYTHING YOU WANT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-11 THESE COMPLAINTS BEGAN TO WORRY DOROTHY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-12 SO SHE HAD A LONG TALK WITH OZMA UPON THE SUBJECT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-13 I SEE I MUST FIND THEM SOMETHING TO DO SAID THE GIRLISH RULER OF OZ SERIOUSLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-14 I HAVE BEEN WATCHING YOUR UNCLE AND AUNT AND I BELIEVE THEY WILL BE MORE CONTENTED IF OCCUPIED WITH SOME LIGHT TASKS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-15 WHILE I AM CONSIDERING THIS MATTER DOROTHY YOU MIGHT MAKE A TRIP WITH THEM THROUGH THE LAND OF OZ VISITING SOME OF THE ODD CORNERS AND INTRODUCING YOUR RELATIVES TO SOME OF OUR CURIOUS PEOPLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-16 OH THAT WOULD BE FINE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-17 EXCLAIMED DOROTHY EAGERLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-18 I WILL GIVE YOU AN ESCORT BEFITTING YOUR RANK AS A PRINCESS CONTINUED OZMA,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-19 AND YOU MAY GO TO SOME OF THE PLACES YOU HAVE NOT YET VISITED YOURSELF AS WELL AS SOME OTHERS THAT YOU KNOW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-20 I WILL MARK OUT A PLAN OF THE TRIP FOR YOU AND HAVE EVERYTHING IN READINESS FOR YOU TO START TO MORROW MORNING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-21 TAKE YOUR TIME DEAR AND BE GONE AS LONG AS YOU WISH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-22 BY THE TIME YOU RETURN I SHALL HAVE FOUND SOME OCCUPATION FOR UNCLE HENRY AND AUNT EM THAT WILL KEEP THEM FROM BEING RESTLESS AND DISSATISFIED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-23 DOROTHY THANKED HER GOOD FRIEND AND KISSED THE LOVELY RULER GRATEFULLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-24 THEN SHE RAN TO TELL THE JOYFUL NEWS TO HER UNCLE AND AUNT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-25 NEXT MORNING AFTER BREAKFAST EVERYTHING WAS FOUND READY FOR THEIR DEPARTURE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-26 THE ESCORT INCLUDED OMBY AMBY THE CAPTAIN GENERAL OF OZMA'S ARMY WHICH CONSISTED MERELY OF TWENTY SEVEN OFFICERS BESIDES THE CAPTAIN GENERAL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-27 ONCE OMBY AMBY HAD BEEN A PRIVATE SOLDIER THE ONLY PRIVATE IN THE ARMY BUT AS THERE WAS NEVER ANY FIGHTING TO DO OZMA SAW NO NEED OF A PRIVATE SO SHE MADE OMBY AMBY THE HIGHEST OFFICER OF THEM ALL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-28 HE WAS VERY TALL AND SLIM AND WORE A GAY UNIFORM AND A FIERCE MUSTACHE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-29 YET THE MUSTACHE WAS THE ONLY FIERCE THING ABOUT OMBY AMBY WHOSE NATURE WAS AS GENTLE AS THAT OF A CHILD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-30 THE WONDERFUL WIZARD HAD ASKED TO JOIN THE PARTY AND WITH HIM CAME HIS FRIEND THE SHAGGY MAN WHO WAS SHAGGY BUT NOT RAGGED BEING DRESSED IN FINE SILKS WITH SATIN SHAGS AND BOBTAILS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-31 THE SHAGGY MAN HAD SHAGGY WHISKERS AND HAIR BUT A SWEET DISPOSITION AND A SOFT PLEASANT VOICE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-32 THERE WAS AN OPEN WAGON WITH THREE SEATS FOR THE PASSENGERS AND THE WAGON WAS DRAWN BY THE FAMOUS WOODEN SAWHORSE WHICH HAD ONCE BEEN BROUGHT TO LIFE BY OZMA BY MEANS OF A MAGIC POWDER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-33 THE SAWHORSE WORE WOODEN SHOES TO KEEP HIS WOODEN LEGS FROM WEARING AWAY AND HE WAS STRONG AND SWIFT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-34 AS THIS CURIOUS CREATURE WAS OZMA'S OWN FAVORITE STEED AND VERY POPULAR WITH ALL THE PEOPLE OF THE EMERALD CITY DOROTHY KNEW THAT SHE HAD BEEN HIGHLY FAVORED BY BEING PERMITTED TO USE THE SAWHORSE ON HER JOURNEY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-35 IN THE FRONT SEAT OF THE WAGON SAT DOROTHY AND THE WIZARD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-36 UNCLE HENRY AND AUNT EM SAT IN THE NEXT SEAT AND THE SHAGGY MAN AND OMBY AMBY IN THE THIRD SEAT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-37 OF COURSE TOTO WAS WITH THE PARTY CURLED UP AT DOROTHY'S FEET AND JUST AS THEY WERE ABOUT TO START BILLINA CAME FLUTTERING ALONG THE PATH AND BEGGED TO BE TAKEN WITH THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-38 DOROTHY READILY AGREED SO THE YELLOW HEN FLEW UP AND PERCHED HERSELF UPON THE DASHBOARD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-39 SHE WORE HER PEARL NECKLACE AND THREE BRACELETS UPON EACH LEG IN HONOR OF THE OCCASION.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-40 DOROTHY KISSED OZMA GOOD BYE AND ALL THE PEOPLE STANDING AROUND WAVED THEIR HANDKERCHIEFS AND THE BAND IN AN UPPER BALCONY STRUCK UP A MILITARY MARCH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-41 THEN THE WIZARD CLUCKED TO THE SAWHORSE AND SAID, GID DAP!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-42 AND THE WOODEN ANIMAL PRANCED AWAY AND DREW BEHIND HIM THE BIG RED WAGON AND ALL THE PASSENGERS WITHOUT ANY EFFORT AT ALL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-43 A SERVANT THREW OPEN A GATE OF THE PALACE ENCLOSURE THAT THEY MIGHT PASS OUT,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-44 AND SO WITH MUSIC AND SHOUTS FOLLOWING THEM THE JOURNEY WAS BEGUN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-45 IT'S ALMOST LIKE A CIRCUS SAID AUNT EM PROUDLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-46 I CAN'T HELP FEELIN HIGH AN MIGHTY IN THIS KIND OF A TURN OUT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-47 INDEED AS THEY PASSED DOWN THE STREET ALL THE PEOPLE CHEERED THEM LUSTILY AND THE SHAGGY MAN AND THE WIZARD AND THE CAPTAIN GENERAL ALL TOOK OFF THEIR HATS AND BOWED POLITELY IN ACKNOWLEDGMENT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-48 WHEN THEY CAME TO THE GREAT WALL OF THE EMERALD CITY THE GATES WERE OPENED BY THE GUARDIAN WHO ALWAYS TENDED THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-49 OVER THE GATEWAY HUNG A DULL COLORED METAL MAGNET SHAPED LIKE A HORSE SHOE PLACED AGAINST A SHIELD OF POLISHED GOLD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-50 THAT SAID THE SHAGGY MAN IMPRESSIVELY IS THE WONDERFUL LOVE MAGNET.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-51 I BROUGHT IT TO THE EMERALD CITY MYSELF AND ALL WHO PASS BENEATH THIS GATEWAY ARE BOTH LOVING AND BELOVED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-52 IT'S A FINE THING DECLARED AUNT EM ADMIRINGLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-53 IF WE'D HAD IT IN KANSAS I GUESS THE MAN WHO HELD A MORTGAGE ON THE FARM WOULDN'T HAVE TURNED US OUT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-54 THEN I'M GLAD WE DIDN'T HAVE IT RETURNED UNCLE HENRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-55 I LIKE OZ BETTER THAN KANSAS EVEN,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-56 AN THIS LITTLE WOOD SAWHORSE BEATS ALL THE CRITTERS I EVER SAW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-57 HE DON'T HAVE TO BE CURRIED OR FED OR WATERED AN HE'S STRONG AS AN OX.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-58 CAN HE TALK DOROTHY?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-59 YES UNCLE REPLIED THE CHILD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-60 BUT THE SAWHORSE NEVER SAYS MUCH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-61 HE TOLD ME ONCE THAT HE CAN'T TALK AND THINK AT THE SAME TIME SO HE PREFERS TO THINK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-62 WHICH IS VERY SENSIBLE DECLARED THE WIZARD NODDING APPROVINGLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-63 WHICH WAY DO WE GO DOROTHY?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-64 STRAIGHT AHEAD INTO THE QUADLING COUNTRY SHE ANSWERED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-65 I'VE GOT A LETTER OF INTERDUCTION TO MISS CUTTENCLIP.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-66 OH!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-67 EXCLAIMED THE WIZARD MUCH INTERESTED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-68 ARE WE GOING THERE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-69 THEN I'M GLAD I CAME FOR I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO MEET THE CUTTENCLIPS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-70 WHO ARE THEY?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-71 INQUIRED AUNT EM. WAIT TILL WE GET THERE REPLIED DOROTHY WITH A LAUGH,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-72 THEN YOU'LL SEE FOR YOURSELF.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-73 I'VE NEVER SEEN THE CUTTENCLIPS YOU KNOW SO I CAN'T ZACTLY SPLAIN EM TO YOU.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-74 ONCE FREE OF THE EMERALD CITY THE SAWHORSE DASHED AWAY AT TREMENDOUS SPEED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-75 INDEED HE WENT SO FAST THAT AUNT EM HAD HARD WORK TO CATCH HER BREATH AND UNCLE HENRY HELD FAST TO THE SEAT OF THE RED WAGON.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-76 GENTLY MY BOY!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-77 CALLED THE WIZARD AND AT THIS THE SAWHORSE SLACKENED HIS SPEED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-78 WHAT'S WRONG?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-79 ASKED THE ANIMAL SLIGHTLY TURNING HIS WOODEN HEAD TO LOOK AT THE PARTY WITH ONE EYE WHICH WAS A KNOT OF WOOD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-80 WHY WE WISH TO ADMIRE THE SCENERY THAT'S ALL ANSWERED THE WIZARD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-81 SOME OF YOUR PASSENGERS ADDED THE SHAGGY MAN HAVE NEVER BEEN OUT OF THE EMERALD CITY BEFORE AND THE COUNTRY IS ALL NEW TO THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-82 IF YOU GO TOO FAST YOU'LL SPOIL ALL THE FUN SAID DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-83 THERE'S NO HURRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-84 VERY WELL,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-85 IT IS ALL THE SAME TO ME OBSERVED THE SAWHORSE,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-86 AND AFTER THAT HE WENT AT A MORE MODERATE PACE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-87 UNCLE HENRY WAS ASTONISHED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-88 HOW CAN A WOODEN THING BE SO INTELLIGENT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-89 HE ASKED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-90 WHY I GAVE HIM SOME SAWDUST BRAINS THE LAST TIME I FITTED HIS HEAD WITH NEW EARS EXPLAINED THE WIZARD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-91 THE SAWDUST WAS MADE FROM HARD KNOTS AND NOW THE SAWHORSE IS ABLE TO THINK OUT ANY KNOTTY PROBLEM HE MEETS WITH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-92 I SEE SAID UNCLE HENRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-93 I DON'T REMARKED AUNT EM,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-94 BUT NO ONE PAID ANY ATTENTION TO THIS STATEMENT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-95 BEFORE LONG THEY CAME TO A STATELY BUILDING THAT STOOD UPON A GREEN PLAIN WITH HANDSOME SHADE TREES GROUPED HERE AND THERE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-96 WHAT IS THAT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-97 ASKED UNCLE HENRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-98 THAT REPLIED THE WIZARD IS THE ROYAL ATHLETIC COLLEGE OF OZ WHICH IS DIRECTED BY PROFESSOR H. M. WOGGLEBUG TE LET'S STOP AND MAKE A CALL SUGGESTED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-99 SO THE SAWHORSE DREW UP IN FRONT OF THE GREAT BUILDING AND THEY WERE MET AT THE DOOR BY THE LEARNED WOGGLEBUG HIMSELF.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-100 HE SEEMED FULLY AS TALL AS THE WIZARD AND WAS DRESSED IN A RED AND WHITE CHECKED VEST AND A BLUE SWALLOW TAILED COAT AND HAD YELLOW KNEE BREECHES AND PURPLE SILK STOCKINGS UPON HIS SLENDER LEGS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-101 A TALL HAT WAS JAUNTILY SET UPON HIS HEAD AND HE WORE SPECTACLES OVER HIS BIG BRIGHT EYES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-102 WELCOME DOROTHY SAID THE WOGGLEBUG,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-103 AND WELCOME TO ALL YOUR FRIENDS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-104 WE ARE INDEED PLEASED TO RECEIVE YOU AT THIS GREAT TEMPLE OF LEARNING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-105 I THOUGHT IT WAS AN ATHLETIC COLLEGE SAID THE SHAGGY MAN. IT IS MY DEAR SIR ANSWERED THE WOGGLEBUG PROUDLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-106 HERE IT IS THAT WE TEACH THE YOUTH OF OUR GREAT LAND SCIENTIFIC COLLEGE ATHLETICS IN ALL THEIR PURITY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-107 DON'T YOU TEACH THEM ANYTHING ELSE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-108 ASKED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-109 DON'T THEY GET ANY READING WRITING AND RITHMETIC?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-110 OH YES,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-111 OF COURSE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-112 THEY GET ALL THOSE AND MORE RETURNED THE PROFESSOR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-113 BUT SUCH THINGS OCCUPY LITTLE OF THEIR TIME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-114 PLEASE FOLLOW ME AND I WILL SHOW YOU HOW MY SCHOLARS ARE USUALLY OCCUPIED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-115 THIS IS A CLASS HOUR AND THEY ARE ALL BUSY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-116 THEY FOLLOWED HIM TO A BIG FIELD BACK OF THE COLLEGE BUILDING WHERE SEVERAL HUNDRED YOUNG OZITES WERE AT THEIR CLASSES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-117 IN ONE PLACE THEY PLAYED FOOTBALL IN ANOTHER BASEBALL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-118 SOME PLAYED TENNIS SOME GOLF,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-119 SOME WERE SWIMMING IN A BIG POOL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-120 UPON A RIVER WHICH WOUND THROUGH THE GROUNDS SEVERAL CREWS IN RACING BOATS WERE ROWING WITH GREAT ENTHUSIASM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-121 OTHER GROUPS OF STUDENTS PLAYED BASKETBALL AND CRICKET WHILE IN ONE PLACE A RING WAS ROPED IN TO PERMIT BOXING AND WRESTLING BY THE ENERGETIC YOUTHS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-122 ALL THE COLLEGIANS SEEMED BUSY AND THERE WAS MUCH LAUGHTER AND SHOUTING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-123 THIS COLLEGE SAID PROFESSOR WOGGLEBUG COMPLACENTLY IS A GREAT SUCCESS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-124 ITS EDUCATIONAL VALUE IS UNDISPUTED AND WE ARE TURNING OUT MANY GREAT AND VALUABLE CITIZENS EVERY YEAR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-125 BUT WHEN DO THEY STUDY?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-126 ASKED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-127 STUDY?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-128 SAID THE WOGGLEBUG LOOKING PERPLEXED AT THE QUESTION.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-129 YES,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-130 WHEN DO THEY GET THEIR RITHMETIC AND JOGERFY AND SUCH THINGS?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-131 OH THEY TAKE DOSES OF THOSE EVERY NIGHT AND MORNING WAS THE REPLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-132 WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY DOSES?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-133 DOROTHY INQUIRED WONDERINGLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-134 WHY WE USE THE NEWLY INVENTED SCHOOL PILLS MADE BY YOUR FRIEND THE WIZARD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-135 THESE PILLS WE HAVE FOUND TO BE VERY EFFECTIVE AND THEY SAVE A LOT OF TIME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-136 PLEASE STEP THIS WAY AND I WILL SHOW YOU OUR LABORATORY OF LEARNING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-137 HE LED THEM TO A ROOM IN THE BUILDING WHERE MANY LARGE BOTTLES WERE STANDING IN ROWS UPON SHELVES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-138 THESE ARE THE ALGEBRA PILLS SAID THE PROFESSOR TAKING DOWN ONE OF THE BOTTLES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-139 ONE AT NIGHT ON RETIRING IS EQUAL TO FOUR HOURS OF STUDY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-140 HERE ARE THE GEOGRAPHY PILLS ONE AT NIGHT AND ONE IN THE MORNING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-141 IN THIS NEXT BOTTLE ARE THE LATIN PILLS ONE THREE TIMES A DAY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-142 THEN WE HAVE THE GRAMMAR PILLS ONE BEFORE EACH MEAL AND THE SPELLING PILLS WHICH ARE TAKEN WHENEVER NEEDED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-143 YOUR SCHOLARS MUST HAVE TO TAKE A LOT OF PILLS REMARKED DOROTHY THOUGHTFULLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-144 HOW DO THEY TAKE EM IN APPLESAUCE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-145 NO MY DEAR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-146 THEY ARE SUGAR COATED AND ARE QUICKLY AND EASILY SWALLOWED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-147 I BELIEVE THE STUDENTS WOULD RATHER TAKE THE PILLS THAN STUDY AND CERTAINLY THE PILLS ARE A MORE EFFECTIVE METHOD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-148 YOU SEE UNTIL THESE SCHOOL PILLS WERE INVENTED WE WASTED A LOT OF TIME IN STUDY THAT MAY NOW BE BETTER EMPLOYED IN PRACTICING ATHLETICS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-149 SEEMS TO ME THE PILLS ARE A GOOD THING SAID OMBY AMBY WHO REMEMBERED HOW IT USED TO MAKE HIS HEAD ACHE AS A BOY TO STUDY ARITHMETIC.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-150 THEY ARE SIR DECLARED THE WOGGLEBUG EARNESTLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-151 THEY GIVE US AN ADVANTAGE OVER ALL OTHER COLLEGES BECAUSE AT NO LOSS OF TIME OUR BOYS BECOME THOROUGHLY CONVERSANT WITH GREEK AND LATIN MATHEMATICS AND GEOGRAPHY GRAMMAR AND LITERATURE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-152 YOU SEE THEY ARE NEVER OBLIGED TO INTERRUPT THEIR GAMES TO ACQUIRE THE LESSER BRANCHES OF LEARNING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-153 IT'S A GREAT INVENTION I'M SURE SAID DOROTHY LOOKING ADMIRINGLY AT THE WIZARD WHO BLUSHED MODESTLY AT THIS PRAISE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-154 WE LIVE IN AN AGE OF PROGRESS ANNOUNCED PROFESSOR WOGGLEBUG POMPOUSLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-155 IT IS EASIER TO SWALLOW KNOWLEDGE THAN TO ACQUIRE IT LABORIOUSLY FROM BOOKS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-156 IS IT NOT SO MY FRIENDS?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-157 SOME FOLKS CAN SWALLOW ANYTHING SAID AUNT EM BUT TO ME THIS SEEMS TOO MUCH LIKE TAKING MEDICINE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-158 YOUNG MEN IN COLLEGE ALWAYS HAVE TO TAKE THEIR MEDICINE ONE WAY OR ANOTHER OBSERVED THE WIZARD WITH A SMILE,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-159 AND AS OUR PROFESSOR SAYS THESE SCHOOL PILLS HAVE PROVED TO BE A GREAT SUCCESS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-160 ONE DAY WHILE I WAS MAKING THEM I HAPPENED TO DROP ONE OF THEM AND ONE OF BILLINA'S CHICKENS GOBBLED IT UP.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-161 A FEW MINUTES AFTERWARD THIS CHICK GOT UPON A ROOST AND RECITED THE BOY STOOD ON THE BURNING DECK WITHOUT MAKING A SINGLE MISTAKE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-162 THEN IT RECITED THE CHARGE OF THE LIGHT BRIGADE AND AFTERWARDS EXCELSIOR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-163 YOU SEE THE CHICKEN HAD EATEN AN ELOCUTION PILL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-09-164 THEY NOW BADE GOOD BYE TO THE PROFESSOR AND THANKING HIM FOR HIS KIND RECEPTION MOUNTED AGAIN INTO THE RED WAGON AND CONTINUED THEIR JOURNEY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-01 CHAPTER TEN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-02 HOW THE CUTTENCLIPS LIVED THE TRAVELERS HAD TAKEN NO PROVISIONS WITH THEM BECAUSE THEY KNEW THAT THEY WOULD BE WELCOMED WHEREVER THEY MIGHT GO IN THE LAND OF OZ AND THAT THE PEOPLE WOULD FEED AND LODGE THEM WITH GENUINE HOSPITALITY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-03 SO ABOUT NOON THEY STOPPED AT A FARM HOUSE AND WERE GIVEN A DELICIOUS LUNCHEON OF BREAD AND MILK FRUITS AND WHEAT CAKES WITH MAPLE SYRUP.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-04 AFTER RESTING A WHILE AND STROLLING THROUGH THE ORCHARDS WITH THEIR HOST A ROUND JOLLY FARMER THEY GOT INTO THE WAGON AND AGAIN STARTED THE SAWHORSE ALONG THE PRETTY WINDING ROAD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-05 THERE WERE SIGNPOSTS AT ALL THE CORNERS AND FINALLY THEY CAME TO ONE WHICH READ, TAKE THIS ROAD TO THE CUTTENCLIPS THERE WAS ALSO A HAND POINTING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION SO THEY TURNED THE SAWHORSE THAT WAY AND FOUND IT A VERY GOOD ROAD BUT SEEMINGLY LITTLE TRAVELED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-06 I'VE NEVER SEEN THE CUTTENCLIPS BEFORE REMARKED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-07 NOR I SAID THE CAPTAIN GENERAL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-08 NOR I SAID THE WIZARD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-09 NOR I SAID BILLINA.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-10 I'VE HARDLY BEEN OUT OF THE EMERALD CITY SINCE I ARRIVED IN THIS COUNTRY ADDED THE SHAGGY MAN. WHY NONE OF US HAS BEEN THERE THEN EXCLAIMED THE LITTLE GIRL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-11 I WONDER WHAT THE CUTTENCLIPS ARE LIKE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-12 WE SHALL SOON FIND OUT SAID THE WIZARD WITH A SLY LAUGH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-13 I'VE HEARD THEY ARE RATHER FLIMSY THINGS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-14 THE FARM HOUSES BECAME FEWER AS THEY PROCEEDED AND THE PATH WAS AT TIMES SO FAINT THAT THE SAWHORSE HAD HARD WORK TO KEEP IN THE ROAD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-15 THE WAGON BEGAN TO JOUNCE TOO,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-16 SO THEY WERE OBLIGED TO GO SLOWLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-17 AFTER A SOMEWHAT WEARISOME JOURNEY THEY CAME IN SIGHT OF A HIGH WALL PAINTED BLUE WITH PINK ORNAMENTS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-18 THIS WALL WAS CIRCULAR AND SEEMED TO ENCLOSE A LARGE SPACE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-19 IT WAS SO HIGH THAT ONLY THE TOPS OF THE TREES COULD BE SEEN ABOVE IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-20 THE PATH LED UP TO A SMALL DOOR IN THE WALL WHICH WAS CLOSED AND LATCHED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-21 UPON THE DOOR WAS A SIGN IN GOLD LETTERS READING AS FOLLOWS, VISITORS ARE REQUESTED TO MOVE SLOWLY AND CAREFULLY AND TO AVOID COUGHING OR MAKING ANY BREEZE OR DRAUGHT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-22 THAT'S STRANGE SAID THE SHAGGY MAN READING THE SIGN ALOUD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-23 WHO ARE THE CUTTENCLIPS ANYHOW?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-24 WHY THEY'RE PAPER DOLLS ANSWERED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-25 DIDN'T YOU KNOW THAT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-26 PAPER DOLLS!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-27 THEN LET'S GO SOMEWHERE ELSE SAID UNCLE HENRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-28 WE'RE ALL TOO OLD TO PLAY WITH DOLLS DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-29 BUT THESE ARE DIFFERENT DECLARED THE GIRL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-30 THEY'RE ALIVE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-31 ALIVE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-32 GASPED AUNT EM IN AMAZEMENT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-33 YES. LET'S GO IN SAID DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-34 SO THEY ALL GOT OUT OF THE WAGON SINCE THE DOOR IN THE WALL WAS NOT BIG ENOUGH FOR THEM TO DRIVE THE SAWHORSE AND WAGON THROUGH IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-35 YOU STAY HERE TOTO!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-36 COMMANDED DOROTHY SHAKING HER FINGER AT THE LITTLE DOG.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-37 YOU'RE SO CARELESS THAT YOU MIGHT MAKE A BREEZE IF I LET YOU INSIDE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-38 TOTO WAGGED HIS TAIL AS IF DISAPPOINTED AT BEING LEFT BEHIND,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-39 BUT HE MADE NO EFFORT TO FOLLOW THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-40 THE WIZARD UNLATCHED THE DOOR WHICH OPENED OUTWARD AND THEY ALL LOOKED EAGERLY INSIDE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-41 JUST BEFORE THE ENTRANCE WAS DRAWN UP A LINE OF TINY SOLDIERS WITH UNIFORMS BRIGHTLY PAINTED AND PAPER GUNS UPON THEIR SHOULDERS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-42 THEY WERE EXACTLY ALIKE FROM ONE END OF THE LINE TO THE OTHER AND ALL WERE CUT OUT OF PAPER AND JOINED TOGETHER IN THE CENTERS OF THEIR BODIES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-43 AS THE VISITORS ENTERED THE ENCLOSURE THE WIZARD LET THE DOOR SWING BACK INTO PLACE AND AT ONCE THE LINE OF SOLDIERS TUMBLED OVER FELL FLAT UPON THEIR BACKS AND LAY FLUTTERING UPON THE GROUND.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-44 HI THERE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-45 CALLED ONE OF THEM,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-46 WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY SLAMMING THE DOOR AND BLOWING US OVER?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-47 I BEG YOUR PARDON I'M SURE SAID THE WIZARD REGRETFULLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-48 I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE SO DELICATE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-49 WE'RE NOT DELICATE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-50 RETORTED ANOTHER SOLDIER RAISING HIS HEAD FROM THE GROUND.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-51 WE ARE STRONG AND HEALTHY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-52 BUT WE CAN'T STAND DRAUGHTS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-53 MAY I HELP YOU UP?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-54 ASKED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-55 IF YOU PLEASE REPLIED THE END SOLDIER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-56 BUT DO IT GENTLY LITTLE GIRL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-57 DOROTHY CAREFULLY STOOD UP THE LINE OF SOLDIERS WHO FIRST DUSTED THEIR PAINTED CLOTHES AND THEN SALUTED THE VISITORS WITH THEIR PAPER MUSKETS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-58 FROM THE END IT WAS EASY TO SEE THAT THE ENTIRE LINE HAD BEEN CUT OUT OF PAPER ALTHOUGH FROM THE FRONT THE SOLDIERS LOOKED RATHER SOLID AND IMPOSING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-59 I'VE A LETTER OF INTRODUCTION FROM PRINCESS OZMA TO MISS CUTTENCLIP ANNOUNCED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-60 VERY WELL SAID THE END SOLDIER AND BLEW UPON A PAPER WHISTLE THAT HUNG AROUND HIS NECK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-61 AT ONCE A PAPER SOLDIER IN A CAPTAIN'S UNIFORM CAME OUT OF A PAPER HOUSE NEAR BY AND APPROACHED THE GROUP AT THE ENTRANCE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-62 HE WAS NOT VERY BIG AND HE WALKED RATHER STIFFLY AND UNCERTAINLY ON HIS PAPER LEGS,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-63 BUT HE HAD A PLEASANT FACE WITH VERY RED CHEEKS AND VERY BLUE EYES AND HE BOWED SO LOW TO THE STRANGERS THAT DOROTHY LAUGHED AND THE BREEZE FROM HER MOUTH NEARLY BLEW THE CAPTAIN OVER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-64 HE WAVERED AND STRUGGLED AND FINALLY MANAGED TO REMAIN UPON HIS FEET.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-65 TAKE CARE MISS!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-66 HE SAID WARNINGLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-67 YOU'RE BREAKING THE RULES YOU KNOW BY LAUGHING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-68 OH I DIDN'T KNOW THAT SHE REPLIED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-69 TO LAUGH IN THIS PLACE IS NEARLY AS DANGEROUS AS TO COUGH SAID THE CAPTAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-70 YOU'LL HAVE TO BREATHE VERY QUIETLY I ASSURE YOU.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-71 WE'LL TRY TO PROMISED THE GIRL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-72 MAY WE SEE MISS CUTTENCLIP PLEASE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-73 YOU MAY PROMPTLY RETURNED THE CAPTAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-74 THIS IS ONE OF HER RECEPTION DAYS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-75 BE GOOD ENOUGH TO FOLLOW ME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-76 HE TURNED AND LED THE WAY UP A PATH AND AS THEY FOLLOWED SLOWLY BECAUSE THE PAPER CAPTAIN DID NOT MOVE VERY SWIFTLY THEY TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO GAZE AROUND THEM AT THIS STRANGE PAPER COUNTRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-77 BESIDE THE PATH WERE PAPER TREES ALL CUT OUT VERY NEATLY AND PAINTED A BRILLIANT GREEN COLOR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-78 AND BACK OF THE TREES WERE ROWS OF CARDBOARD HOUSES PAINTED IN VARIOUS COLORS BUT MOST OF THEM HAVING GREEN BLINDS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-79 SOME WERE LARGE AND SOME SMALL AND IN THE FRONT YARDS WERE BEDS OF PAPER FLOWERS QUITE NATURAL IN APPEARANCE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-80 OVER SOME OF THE PORCHES PAPER VINES WERE TWINED GIVING THEM A COZY AND SHADY LOOK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-81 AS THE VISITORS PASSED ALONG THE STREET A GOOD MANY PAPER DOLLS CAME TO THE DOORS AND WINDOWS OF THEIR HOUSES TO LOOK AT THEM CURIOUSLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-82 THESE DOLLS WERE NEARLY ALL THE SAME HEIGHT BUT WERE CUT INTO VARIOUS SHAPES SOME BEING FAT AND SOME LEAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-83 THE GIRL DOLLS WORE MANY BEAUTIFUL COSTUMES OF TISSUE PAPER MAKING THEM QUITE FLUFFY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-84 BUT THEIR HEADS AND HANDS WERE NO THICKER THAN THE PAPER OF WHICH THEY WERE MADE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-85 SOME OF THE PAPER PEOPLE WERE ON THE STREET WALKING ALONG OR CONGREGATED IN GROUPS AND TALKING TOGETHER,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-86 BUT AS SOON AS THEY SAW THE STRANGERS THEY ALL FLUTTERED INTO THE HOUSES AS FAST AS THEY COULD GO SO AS TO BE OUT OF DANGER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-87 EXCUSE ME IF I GO EDGEWISE REMARKED THE CAPTAIN AS THEY CAME TO A SLIGHT HILL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-88 I CAN GET ALONG FASTER THAT WAY AND NOT FLUTTER SO MUCH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-89 THAT'S ALL RIGHT SAID DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-90 WE DON'T MIND HOW YOU GO I'M SURE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-91 AT ONE SIDE OF THE STREET WAS A PAPER PUMP AND A PAPER BOY WAS PUMPING PAPER WATER INTO A PAPER PAIL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-92 THE YELLOW HEN HAPPENED TO BRUSH AGAINST THIS BOY WITH HER WING AND HE FLEW INTO THE AIR AND FELL INTO A PAPER TREE WHERE HE STUCK UNTIL THE WIZARD GENTLY PULLED HIM OUT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-93 AT THE SAME TIME THE PAIL WENT INTO THE AIR SPILLING THE PAPER WATER WHILE THE PAPER PUMP BENT NEARLY DOUBLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-94 GOODNESS ME!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-95 SAID THE HEN. IF I SHOULD FLOP MY WINGS I BELIEVE I'D KNOCK OVER THE WHOLE VILLAGE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-96 THEN DON'T FLOP THEM PLEASE DON'T!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-97 ENTREATED THE CAPTAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-98 MISS CUTTENCLIP WOULD BE VERY MUCH DISTRESSED IF HER VILLAGE WAS SPOILED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-99 OH I'LL BE CAREFUL PROMISED BILLINA.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-100 ARE NOT ALL THESE PAPER GIRLS AND WOMEN NAMED MISS CUTTENCLIPS?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-101 INQUIRED OMBY AMBY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-102 NO INDEED ANSWERED THE CAPTAIN WHO WAS WALKING BETTER SINCE HE BEGAN TO MOVE EDGEWISE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-103 THERE IS BUT ONE MISS CUTTENCLIP WHO IS OUR QUEEN BECAUSE SHE MADE US ALL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-104 THESE GIRLS ARE CUTTENCLIPS TO BE SURE BUT THEIR NAMES ARE EMILY AND POLLY AND SUE AND BETTY AND SUCH THINGS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-105 ONLY THE QUEEN IS CALLED MISS CUTTENCLIP.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-106 I MUST SAY THAT THIS PLACE BEATS ANYTHING I EVER HEARD OF OBSERVED AUNT EM. I USED TO PLAY WITH PAPER DOLLS MYSELF AN CUT EM OUT,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-107 BUT I NEVER THOUGHT I'D EVER SEE SUCH THINGS ALIVE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-108 I DON'T SEE AS IT'S ANY MORE CURIOUS THAN HEARING HENS TALK RETURNED UNCLE HENRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-109 YOU'RE LIKELY TO SEE MANY QUEER THINGS IN THE LAND OF OZ SIR SAID THE WIZARD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-110 BUT A FAIRY COUNTRY IS EXTREMELY INTERESTING WHEN YOU GET USED TO BEING SURPRISED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-111 HERE WE ARE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-112 CALLED THE CAPTAIN STOPPING BEFORE A COTTAGE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-113 THIS HOUSE WAS MADE OF WOOD AND WAS REMARKABLY PRETTY IN DESIGN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-114 IN THE EMERALD CITY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED A TINY DWELLING INDEED,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-115 BUT IN THE MIDST OF THIS PAPER VILLAGE IT SEEMED IMMENSE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-116 REAL FLOWERS WERE IN THE GARDEN AND REAL TREES GREW BESIDE IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-117 UPON THE FRONT DOOR WAS A SIGN READING, MISS CUTTENCLIP.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-118 JUST AS THEY REACHED THE PORCH THE FRONT DOOR OPENED AND A LITTLE GIRL STOOD BEFORE THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-119 SHE APPEARED TO BE ABOUT THE SAME AGE AS DOROTHY AND SMILING UPON HER VISITORS SHE SAID SWEETLY, YOU ARE WELCOME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-120 ALL THE PARTY SEEMED RELIEVED TO FIND THAT HERE WAS A REAL GIRL OF FLESH AND BLOOD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-121 SHE WAS VERY DAINTY AND PRETTY AS SHE STOOD THERE WELCOMING THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-122 HER HAIR WAS A GOLDEN BLONDE AND HER EYES TURQUOISE BLUE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-123 SHE HAD ROSY CHEEKS AND LOVELY WHITE TEETH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-124 OVER HER SIMPLE WHITE LAWN DRESS SHE WORE AN APRON WITH PINK AND WHITE CHECKS AND IN ONE HAND SHE HELD A PAIR OF SCISSORS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-125 MAY WE SEE MISS CUTTENCLIP PLEASE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-126 ASKED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-127 I AM MISS CUTTENCLIP WAS THE REPLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-128 WON'T YOU COME IN?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-129 SHE HELD THE DOOR OPEN WHILE THEY ALL ENTERED A PRETTY SITTING ROOM THAT WAS LITTERED WITH ALL SORTS OF PAPER SOME STIFF SOME THIN AND SOME TISSUE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-130 THE SHEETS AND SCRAPS WERE OF ALL COLORS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-131 UPON A TABLE WERE PAINTS AND BRUSHES WHILE SEVERAL PAIR OF SCISSORS OF DIFFERENT SIZES WERE LYING ABOUT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-132 SIT DOWN PLEASE SAID MISS CUTTENCLIP CLEARING THE PAPER SCRAPS OFF SOME OF THE CHAIRS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-133 IT IS SO LONG SINCE I HAVE HAD ANY VISITORS THAT I AM NOT PROPERLY PREPARED TO RECEIVE THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-134 BUT I'M SURE YOU WILL PARDON MY UNTIDY ROOM FOR THIS IS MY WORKSHOP.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-135 DO YOU MAKE ALL THE PAPER DOLLS?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-136 INQUIRED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-137 YES,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-138 I CUT THEM OUT WITH MY SCISSORS AND PAINT THE FACES AND SOME OF THE COSTUMES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-139 IT IS VERY PLEASANT WORK AND I AM HAPPY MAKING MY PAPER VILLAGE GROW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-140 BUT HOW DO THE PAPER DOLLS HAPPEN TO BE ALIVE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-141 ASKED AUNT EM. THE FIRST DOLLS I MADE WERE NOT ALIVE SAID MISS CUTTENCLIP.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-142 I USED TO LIVE NEAR THE CASTLE OF A GREAT SORCERESS NAMED GLINDA THE GOOD AND SHE SAW MY DOLLS AND SAID THEY WERE VERY PRETTY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-143 I TOLD HER I THOUGHT I WOULD LIKE THEM BETTER IF THEY WERE ALIVE AND THE NEXT DAY THE SORCERESS BROUGHT ME A LOT OF MAGIC PAPER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-144 IS LIVE PAPER SHE SAID AND ALL THE DOLLS YOU CUT OUT OF IT WILL BE ALIVE AND ABLE TO THINK AND TO TALK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-145 WHEN YOU HAVE USED IT ALL UP COME TO ME AND I WILL GIVE YOU MORE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-146 OF COURSE I WAS DELIGHTED WITH THIS PRESENT CONTINUED MISS CUTTENCLIP AND AT ONCE SET TO WORK AND MADE SEVERAL PAPER DOLLS WHICH AS SOON AS THEY WERE CUT OUT BEGAN TO WALK AROUND AND TALK TO ME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-147 BUT THEY WERE SO THIN THAT I FOUND THAT ANY BREEZE WOULD BLOW THEM OVER AND SCATTER THEM DREADFULLY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-148 SO GLINDA FOUND THIS LONELY PLACE FOR ME WHERE FEW PEOPLE EVER COME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-149 SHE BUILT THE WALL TO KEEP ANY WIND FROM BLOWING AWAY MY PEOPLE AND TOLD ME I COULD BUILD A PAPER VILLAGE HERE AND BE ITS QUEEN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-150 THAT IS WHY I CAME HERE AND SETTLED DOWN TO WORK AND STARTED THE VILLAGE YOU NOW SEE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-151 IT WAS MANY YEARS AGO THAT I BUILT THE FIRST HOUSES AND I'VE KEPT PRETTY BUSY AND MADE MY VILLAGE GROW FINELY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-152 AND I NEED NOT TELL YOU THAT I AM VERY HAPPY IN MY WORK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-153 MANY YEARS AGO!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-154 EXCLAIMED AUNT EM. WHY HOW OLD ARE YOU CHILD?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-155 I NEVER KEEP TRACK OF THE YEARS SAID MISS CUTTENCLIP LAUGHING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-156 YOU SEE I DON'T GROW UP AT ALL BUT STAY JUST THE SAME AS I WAS WHEN FIRST I CAME HERE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-157 PERHAPS I'M OLDER EVEN THAN YOU ARE MADAM,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-158 BUT I COULDN'T SAY FOR SURE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-159 THEY LOOKED AT THE LOVELY LITTLE GIRL WONDERINGLY AND THE WIZARD ASKED, WHAT HAPPENS TO YOUR PAPER VILLAGE WHEN IT RAINS?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-160 IT DOES NOT RAIN HERE REPLIED MISS CUTTENCLIP.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-161 GLINDA KEEPS ALL THE RAIN STORMS AWAY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-162 SO I NEVER WORRY ABOUT MY DOLLS GETTING WET.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-163 BUT NOW IF YOU WILL COME WITH ME IT WILL GIVE ME PLEASURE TO SHOW YOU OVER MY PAPER KINGDOM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-164 OF COURSE YOU MUST GO SLOWLY AND CAREFULLY AND AVOID MAKING ANY BREEZE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-165 THEY LEFT THE COTTAGE AND FOLLOWED THEIR GUIDE THROUGH THE VARIOUS STREETS OF THE VILLAGE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-166 IT WAS INDEED AN AMAZING PLACE WHEN ONE CONSIDERED THAT IT WAS ALL MADE WITH SCISSORS AND THE VISITORS WERE NOT ONLY GREATLY INTERESTED BUT FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR THE SKILL OF LITTLE MISS CUTTENCLIP.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-167 IN ONE PLACE A LARGE GROUP OF ESPECIALLY NICE PAPER DOLLS ASSEMBLED TO GREET THEIR QUEEN WHOM IT WAS EASY TO SEE THEY LOVED EARLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-168 THESE DOLLS MARCHED AND DANCED BEFORE THE VISITORS AND THEN THEY ALL WAVED THEIR PAPER HANDKERCHIEFS AND SANG IN A SWEET CHORUS A SONG CALLED THE FLAG OF OUR NATIVE LAND.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-169 AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE SONG THEY RAN UP A HANDSOME PAPER FLAG ON A TALL FLAGPOLE AND ALL OF THE PEOPLE OF THE VILLAGE GATHERED AROUND TO CHEER AS LOUDLY AS THEY COULD ALTHOUGH OF COURSE THEIR VOICES WERE NOT ESPECIALLY STRONG.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-170 MISS CUTTENCLIP WAS ABOUT TO MAKE HER SUBJECTS A SPEECH IN REPLY TO THIS PATRIOTIC SONG WHEN THE SHAGGY MAN HAPPENED TO SNEEZE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-171 HE WAS A VERY LOUD AND POWERFUL SNEEZER AT ANY TIME AND HE HAD TRIED SO HARD TO HOLD IN THIS SNEEZE THAT WHEN IT SUDDENLY EXPLODED THE RESULT WAS TERRIBLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-172 THE PAPER DOLLS WERE MOWED DOWN BY DOZENS AND FLEW AND FLUTTERED IN WILD CONFUSION IN EVERY DIRECTION TUMBLING THIS WAY AND THAT AND GETTING MORE OR LESS WRINKLED AND BENT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-173 A WAIL OF TERROR AND GRIEF CAME FROM THE SCATTERED THRONG AND MISS CUTTENCLIP EXCLAIMED, DEAR ME!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-174 DEAR ME!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-175 AND HURRIED AT ONCE TO THE RESCUE OF HER OVERTURNED PEOPLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-176 OH SHAGGY MAN!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-177 HOW COULD YOU?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-178 ASKED DOROTHY REPROACHFULLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-179 I COULDN'T HELP IT REALLY I COULDN'T PROTESTED THE SHAGGY MAN LOOKING QUITE ASHAMED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-180 AND I HAD NO IDEA IT TOOK SO LITTLE TO UPSET THESE PAPER DOLLS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-181 SO LITTLE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-182 SAID DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-183 WHY IT WAS MOST AS BAD AS A KANSAS CYCLONE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-184 AND THEN SHE HELPED MISS CUTTENCLIP RESCUE THE PAPER FOLK AND STAND THEM ON THEIR FEET AGAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-185 TWO OF THE CARDBOARD HOUSES HAD ALSO TUMBLED OVER AND THE LITTLE QUEEN SAID SHE WOULD HAVE TO REPAIR THEM AND PASTE THEM TOGETHER BEFORE THEY COULD BE LIVED IN AGAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-186 AND NOW FEARING THEY MIGHT DO MORE DAMAGE TO THE FLIMSY PAPER PEOPLE THEY DECIDED TO GO AWAY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-187 BUT FIRST THEY THANKED MISS CUTTENCLIP VERY WARMLY FOR HER COURTESY AND KINDNESS TO THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-188 ANY FRIEND OF PRINCESS OZMA IS ALWAYS WELCOME HERE UNLESS HE SNEEZES SAID THE QUEEN WITH A RATHER SEVERE LOOK AT THE SHAGGY MAN WHO HUNG HIS HEAD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-189 I LIKE TO HAVE VISITORS ADMIRE MY WONDERFUL VILLAGE AND I HOPE YOU WILL CALL AGAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-190 MISS CUTTENCLIP HERSELF LED THEM TO THE DOOR IN THE WALL AND AS THEY PASSED ALONG THE STREET THE PAPER DOLLS PEEPED AT THEM HALF FEARFULLY FROM THE DOORS AND WINDOWS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-10-191 PERHAPS THEY WILL NEVER FORGET THE SHAGGY MAN'S AWFUL SNEEZE AND I AM SURE THEY WERE ALL GLAD TO SEE THE MEAT PEOPLE GO AWAY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-01 CHAPTER ELEVEN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-02 HOW THE GENERAL MET THE FIRST AND FOREMOST ON LEAVING THE GROWLEYWOGS GENERAL GUPH HAD TO RECROSS THE RIPPLE LANDS AND HE DID NOT FIND IT A PLEASANT THING TO DO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-03 PERHAPS HAVING HIS WHISKERS PULLED OUT ONE BY ONE AND BEING USED AS A PIN CUSHION FOR THE INNOCENT AMUSEMENT OF A GOOD NATURED JAILER HAD NOT IMPROVED THE QUALITY OF GUPH'S TEMPER FOR THE OLD NOME RAVED AND RAGED AT THE RECOLLECTION OF THE WRONGS HE HAD SUFFERED AND VOWED TO TAKE VENGEANCE UPON THE GROWLEYWOGS AFTER HE HAD USED THEM FOR HIS PURPOSES AND OZ HAD BEEN CONQUERED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-04 HE WENT ON IN THIS FURIOUS WAY UNTIL HE WAS HALF ACROSS THE RIPPLE LAND.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-05 THEN HE BECAME SEASICK AND THE REST OF THE WAY THIS NAUGHTY NOME WAS ALMOST AS MISERABLE AS HE DESERVED TO BE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-06 BUT WHEN HE REACHED THE PLAINS AGAIN AND THE GROUND WAS FIRM UNDER HIS FEET HE BEGAN TO FEEL BETTER AND INSTEAD OF GOING BACK HOME HE TURNED DIRECTLY WEST.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-07 A SQUIRREL PERCHED IN A TREE SAW HIM TAKE THIS ROAD AND CALLED TO HIM WARNINGLY, LOOK OUT!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-08 BUT HE PAID NO ATTENTION.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-09 AN EAGLE PAUSED IN ITS FLIGHT THROUGH THE AIR TO LOOK AT HIM WONDERINGLY AND SAY, LOOK OUT!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-10 BUT ON HE WENT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-11 NO ONE CAN SAY THAT GUPH WAS NOT BRAVE FOR HE HAD DETERMINED TO VISIT THOSE DANGEROUS CREATURES THE PHANFASMS WHO RESIDED UPON THE VERY TOP OF THE DREAD MOUNTAIN OF PHANTASTICO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-12 THE PHANFASMS WERE ERBS AND SO DREADED BY MORTALS AND IMMORTALS ALIKE THAT NO ONE HAD BEEN NEAR THEIR MOUNTAIN HOME FOR SEVERAL THOUSAND YEARS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-13 YET GENERAL GUPH HOPED TO INDUCE THEM TO JOIN IN HIS PROPOSED WARFARE AGAINST THE GOOD AND HAPPY OZ PEOPLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-14 GUPH KNEW VERY WELL THAT THE PHANFASMS WOULD BE ALMOST AS DANGEROUS TO THE NOMES AS THEY WOULD TO THE OZITES BUT HE THOUGHT HIMSELF SO CLEVER THAT HE BELIEVED HE COULD MANAGE THESE STRANGE CREATURES AND MAKE THEM OBEY HIM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-15 AND THERE WAS NO DOUBT AT ALL THAT IF HE COULD ENLIST THE SERVICES OF THE PHANFASMS THEIR TREMENDOUS POWER UNITED TO THE STRENGTH OF THE GROWLEYWOGS AND THE CUNNING OF THE WHIMSIES WOULD DOOM THE LAND OF OZ TO ABSOLUTE DESTRUCTION.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-16 SO THE OLD NOME CLIMBED THE FOOTHILLS AND TRUDGED ALONG THE WILD MOUNTAIN PATHS UNTIL HE CAME TO A BIG GULLY THAT ENCIRCLED THE MOUNTAIN OF PHANTASTICO AND MARKED THE BOUNDARY LINE OF THE DOMINION OF THE PHANFASMS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-17 THIS GULLY WAS ABOUT A THIRD OF THE WAY UP THE MOUNTAIN AND IT WAS FILLED TO THE BRIM WITH RED HOT MOLTEN LAVA IN WHICH SWAM FIRE SERPENTS AND POISONOUS SALAMANDERS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-18 THE HEAT FROM THIS MASS AND ITS POISONOUS SMELL WERE BOTH SO UNBEARABLE THAT EVEN BIRDS HESITATED TO FLY OVER THE GULLY BUT CIRCLED AROUND IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-19 ALL LIVING THINGS KEPT AWAY FROM THE MOUNTAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-20 NOW GUPH HAD HEARD DURING HIS LONG LIFETIME MANY TALES OF THESE DREADED PHANFASMS,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-21 SO HE HAD HEARD OF THIS BARRIER OF MELTED LAVA AND ALSO HE HAD BEEN TOLD THAT THERE WAS A NARROW BRIDGE THAT SPANNED IT IN ONE PLACE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-22 SO HE WALKED ALONG THE EDGE UNTIL HE FOUND THE BRIDGE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-23 IT WAS A SINGLE ARCH OF GRAY STONE AND LYING FLAT UPON THE BRIDGE WAS A SCARLET ALLIGATOR SEEMINGLY FAST ASLEEP.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-24 WHEN GUPH STUMBLED OVER THE ROCKS IN APPROACHING THE BRIDGE THE CREATURE OPENED ITS EYES FROM WHICH TINY FLAMES SHOT IN ALL DIRECTIONS AND AFTER LOOKING AT THE INTRUDER VERY WICKEDLY THE SCARLET ALLIGATOR CLOSED ITS EYELIDS AGAIN AND LAY STILL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-25 GUPH SAW THERE WAS NO ROOM FOR HIM TO PASS THE ALLIGATOR ON THE NARROW BRIDGE SO HE CALLED OUT TO IT, GOOD MORNING FRIEND.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-26 I DON'T WISH TO HURRY YOU BUT PLEASE TELL ME IF YOU ARE COMING DOWN OR GOING UP?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-27 NEITHER SNAPPED THE ALLIGATOR CLICKING ITS CRUEL JAWS TOGETHER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-28 THE GENERAL HESITATED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-29 ARE YOU LIKELY TO STAY THERE LONG?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-30 HE ASKED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-31 A FEW HUNDRED YEARS OR SO SAID THE ALLIGATOR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-32 GUPH SOFTLY RUBBED THE END OF HIS NOSE AND TRIED TO THINK WHAT TO DO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-33 DO YOU KNOW WHETHER THE FIRST AND FOREMOST PHANFASM OF PHANTASTICO IS AT HOME OR NOT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-34 HE PRESENTLY INQUIRED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-35 I EXPECT HE IS SEEING HE IS ALWAYS AT HOME REPLIED THE ALLIGATOR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-36 AH,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-37 WHO IS THAT COMING DOWN THE MOUNTAIN?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-38 ASKED THE NOME GAZING UPWARD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-39 THE ALLIGATOR TURNED TO LOOK OVER ITS SHOULDER AND AT ONCE GUPH RAN TO THE BRIDGE AND LEAPED OVER THE SENTINEL'S BACK BEFORE IT COULD TURN BACK AGAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-40 THE SCARLET MONSTER MADE A SNAP AT THE NOME'S LEFT FOOT BUT MISSED IT BY FULLY AN INCH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-41 AH HA!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-42 LAUGHED THE GENERAL WHO WAS NOW ON THE MOUNTAIN PATH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-43 I FOOLED YOU THAT TIME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-44 SO YOU DID,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-45 AND PERHAPS YOU FOOLED YOURSELF RETORTED THE ALLIGATOR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-46 GO UP THE MOUNTAIN IF YOU DARE AND FIND OUT WHAT THE FIRST AND FOREMOST WILL DO TO YOU!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-47 I WILL DECLARED GUPH BOLDLY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-48 AND ON HE WENT UP THE PATH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-49 AT FIRST THE SCENE WAS WILD ENOUGH BUT GRADUALLY IT GREW MORE AND MORE AWFUL IN APPEARANCE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-50 ALL THE ROCKS HAD THE SHAPES OF FRIGHTFUL BEINGS AND EVEN THE TREE TRUNKS WERE GNARLED AND TWISTED LIKE SERPENTS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-51 SUDDENLY THERE APPEARED BEFORE THE NOME A MAN WITH THE HEAD OF AN OWL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-52 HIS BODY WAS HAIRY LIKE THAT OF AN APE AND HIS ONLY CLOTHING WAS A SCARLET SCARF TWISTED AROUND HIS WAIST.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-53 HE BORE A HUGE CLUB IN HIS HAND AND HIS ROUND OWL EYES BLINKED FIERCELY UPON THE INTRUDER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-54 WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-55 HE DEMANDED THREATENING GUPH WITH HIS CLUB.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-56 I'VE COME TO SEE THE FIRST AND FOREMOST PHANFASM OF PHANTASTICO REPLIED THE GENERAL WHO DID NOT LIKE THE WAY THIS CREATURE LOOKED AT HIM BUT STILL WAS NOT AFRAID.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-57 AH,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-58 YOU SHALL SEE HIM!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-59 THE MAN SAID WITH A SNEERING LAUGH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-60 THE FIRST AND FOREMOST SHALL DECIDE UPON THE BEST WAY TO PUNISH YOU.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-61 HE WILL NOT PUNISH ME RETURNED GUPH CALMLY FOR I HAVE COME HERE TO DO HIM AND HIS PEOPLE A RARE FAVOR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-62 LEAD ON FELLOW AND TAKE ME DIRECTLY TO YOUR MASTER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-63 THE OWL MAN RAISED HIS CLUB WITH A THREATENING GESTURE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-64 IF YOU TRY TO ESCAPE HE SAID BEWARE BUT HERE THE GENERAL INTERRUPTED HIM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-65 SPARE YOUR THREATS SAID HE AND DO NOT BE IMPERTINENT OR I WILL HAVE YOU SEVERELY PUNISHED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-66 LEAD ON AND KEEP SILENT!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-67 THIS GUPH WAS REALLY A CLEVER RASCAL AND IT SEEMS A PITY HE WAS SO BAD FOR IN A GOOD CAUSE HE MIGHT HAVE ACCOMPLISHED MUCH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-68 HE REALIZED THAT HE HAD PUT HIMSELF INTO A DANGEROUS POSITION BY COMING TO THIS DREADFUL MOUNTAIN BUT HE ALSO KNEW THAT IF HE SHOWED FEAR HE WAS LOST.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-69 SO HE ADOPTED A BOLD MANNER AS HIS BEST DEFENSE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-70 THE WISDOM OF THIS PLAN WAS SOON EVIDENT FOR THE PHANFASM WITH THE OWL'S HEAD TURNED AND LED THE WAY UP THE MOUNTAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-71 AT THE VERY TOP WAS A LEVEL PLAIN UPON WHICH WERE HEAPS OF ROCK THAT AT FIRST GLANCE SEEMED SOLID.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-72 BUT ON LOOKING CLOSER GUPH DISCOVERED THAT THESE ROCK HEAPS WERE DWELLINGS FOR EACH HAD AN OPENING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-73 NOT A PERSON WAS TO BE SEEN OUTSIDE THE ROCK HUTS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-74 ALL WAS SILENT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-75 THE OWL MAN LED THE WAY AMONG THE GROUPS OF DWELLINGS TO ONE STANDING IN THE CENTER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-76 IT SEEMED NO BETTER AND NO WORSE THAN ANY OF THE OTHERS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-77 OUTSIDE THE ENTRANCE TO THIS ROCK HEAP THE GUIDE GAVE A LOW WAIL THAT SOUNDED LIKE LEE OW AH!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-78 SUDDENLY THERE BOUNDED FROM THE OPENING ANOTHER HAIRY MAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-79 THIS ONE WORE THE HEAD OF A BEAR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-80 IN HIS HAND HE BORE A BRASS HOOP.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-81 HE GLARED AT THE STRANGER IN EVIDENT SURPRISE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-82 WHY HAVE YOU CAPTURED THIS FOOLISH WANDERER AND BROUGHT HIM HERE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-83 HE DEMANDED ADDRESSING THE OWL MAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-84 I DID NOT CAPTURE HIM WAS THE ANSWER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-85 HE PASSED THE SCARLET ALLIGATOR AND CAME HERE OF HIS OWN FREE WILL AND ACCORD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-86 THE FIRST AND FOREMOST LOOKED AT THE GENERAL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-87 HAVE YOU TIRED OF LIFE THEN?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-88 HE ASKED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-89 NO INDEED ANSWERED GUPH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-90 I AM A NOME AND THE CHIEF GENERAL OF KING ROQUAT THE RED'S GREAT ARMY OF NOMES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-91 I COME OF A LONG LIVED RACE AND I MAY SAY THAT I EXPECT TO LIVE A LONG TIME YET.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-92 SIT DOWN YOU PHANFASMS IF YOU CAN FIND A SEAT IN THIS WILD HAUNT AND LISTEN TO WHAT I HAVE TO SAY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-93 WITH ALL HIS KNOWLEDGE AND BRAVERY GENERAL GUPH DID NOT KNOW THAT THE STEADY GLARE FROM THE BEAR EYES WAS READING HIS INMOST THOUGHTS AS SURELY AS IF THEY HAD BEEN PUT INTO WORDS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-94 HE DID NOT KNOW THAT THESE DESPISED ROCK HEAPS OF THE PHANFASMS WERE MERELY DECEPTIONS TO HIS OWN EYES NOR COULD HE GUESS THAT HE WAS STANDING IN THE MIDST OF ONE OF THE MOST SPLENDID AND LUXURIOUS CITIES EVER BUILT BY MAGIC POWER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-95 ALL THAT HE SAW WAS A BARREN WASTE OF ROCK HEAPS A HAIRY MAN WITH AN OWL'S HEAD AND ANOTHER WITH A BEAR'S HEAD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-96 THE SORCERY OF THE PHANFASMS PERMITTED HIM TO SEE NO MORE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-97 SUDDENLY THE FIRST AND FOREMOST SWUNG HIS BRASS HOOP AND CAUGHT GUPH AROUND THE NECK WITH IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-98 THE NEXT INSTANT BEFORE THE GENERAL COULD THINK WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM HE WAS DRAGGED INSIDE THE ROCK HUT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-99 HERE HIS EYES STILL BLINDED TO REALITIES HE PERCEIVED ONLY A DIM LIGHT BY WHICH THE HUT SEEMED AS ROUGH AND RUDE INSIDE AS IT WAS OUTSIDE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-100 YET HE HAD A STRANGE FEELING THAT MANY BRIGHT EYES WERE FASTENED UPON HIM AND THAT HE STOOD IN A VAST AND EXTENSIVE HALL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-101 THE FIRST AND FOREMOST NOW LAUGHED GRIMLY AND RELEASED HIS PRISONER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-102 IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY THAT IS INTERESTING HE REMARKED SPEAK OUT BEFORE I STRANGLE YOU.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-103 SO GUPH SPOKE OUT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-104 HE TRIED NOT TO PAY ANY ATTENTION TO A STRANGE RUSTLING SOUND THAT HE HEARD AS OF AN UNSEEN MULTITUDE DRAWING NEAR TO LISTEN TO HIS WORDS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-105 HIS EYES COULD SEE ONLY THE FIERCE BEAR MAN AND TO HIM HE ADDRESSED HIS SPEECH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-106 FIRST HE TOLD OF HIS PLAN TO CONQUER THE LAND OF OZ AND PLUNDER THE COUNTRY OF ITS RICHES AND ENSLAVE ITS PEOPLE WHO BEING FAIRIES COULD NOT BE KILLED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-107 AFTER RELATING ALL THIS AND TELLING OF THE TUNNEL THE NOME KING WAS BUILDING HE SAID HE HAD COME TO ASK THE FIRST AND FOREMOST TO JOIN THE NOMES WITH HIS BAND OF TERRIBLE WARRIORS AND HELP THEM TO DEFEAT THE OZ PEOPLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-108 THE GENERAL SPOKE VERY EARNESTLY AND IMPRESSIVELY BUT WHEN HE HAD FINISHED THE BEAR MAN BEGAN TO LAUGH AS IF MUCH AMUSED AND HIS LAUGHTER SEEMED TO BE ECHOED BY A CHORUS OF MERRIMENT FROM AN UNSEEN MULTITUDE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-109 THEN FOR THE FIRST TIME GUPH BEGAN TO FEEL A TRIFLE WORRIED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-110 WHO ELSE HAS PROMISED TO HELP YOU?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-111 FINALLY ASKED THE FIRST AND FOREMOST.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-112 THE WHIMSIES REPLIED THE GENERAL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-113 AGAIN THE BEAR HEADED PHANFASM LAUGHED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-114 ANY OTHERS?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-115 HE INQUIRED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-116 ONLY THE GROWLEYWOGS SAID GUPH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-117 THIS ANSWER SET THE FIRST AND FOREMOST LAUGHING ANEW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-118 WHAT SHARE OF THE SPOILS AM I TO HAVE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-119 WAS THE NEXT QUESTION.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-120 ANYTHING YOU LIKE EXCEPT KING ROQUAT'S MAGIC BELT REPLIED GUPH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-121 AT THIS THE PHANFASM SET UP A ROAR OF LAUGHTER WHICH HAD ITS ECHO IN THE UNSEEN CHORUS AND THE BEAR MAN SEEMED SO AMUSED THAT HE ACTUALLY ROLLED UPON THE GROUND AND SHOUTED WITH MERRIMENT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-122 OH THESE BLIND AND FOOLISH NOMES!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-123 HE SAID.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-124 HOW BIG THEY SEEM TO THEMSELVES AND HOW SMALL THEY REALLY ARE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-125 SUDDENLY HE AROSE AND SEIZED GUPH'S NECK WITH ONE HAIRY PAW DRAGGING HIM OUT OF THE HUT INTO THE OPEN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-126 HERE HE GAVE A CURIOUS WAILING CRY AND AS IF IN ANSWER FROM ALL THE ROCKY HUTS ON THE MOUNTAIN TOP CAME FLOCKING A HORDE OF PHANFASMS ALL WITH HAIRY BODIES BUT WEARING HEADS OF VARIOUS ANIMALS BIRDS AND REPTILES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-127 ALL WERE FEROCIOUS AND REPULSIVE LOOKING TO THE DECEIVED EYES OF THE NOME AND GUPH COULD NOT REPRESS A SHUDDER OF DISGUST AS HE LOOKED UPON THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-128 THE FIRST AND FOREMOST SLOWLY RAISED HIS ARMS AND IN A TWINKLING HIS HAIRY SKIN FELL FROM HIM AND HE APPEARED BEFORE THE ASTONISHED NOME AS A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN CLOTHED IN A FLOWING GOWN OF PINK GAUZE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-129 IN HER DARK HAIR FLOWERS WERE ENTWINED AND HER FACE WAS NOBLE AND CALM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-130 AT THE SAME INSTANT THE ENTIRE BAND OF PHANFASMS WAS TRANSFORMED INTO A PACK OF HOWLING WOLVES RUNNING HERE AND THERE AS THEY SNARLED AND SHOWED THEIR UGLY YELLOW FANGS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-131 THE WOMAN NOW RAISED HER ARMS EVEN AS THE MAN BEAR HAD DONE AND IN A TWINKLING THE WOLVES BECAME CRAWLING LIZARDS WHILE SHE HERSELF CHANGED INTO A HUGE BUTTERFLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-132 GUPH HAD ONLY TIME TO CRY OUT IN FEAR AND TAKE A STEP BACKWARD TO AVOID THE LIZARDS WHEN ANOTHER TRANSFORMATION OCCURRED AND ALL RETURNED INSTANTLY TO THE FORMS THEY HAD ORIGINALLY WORN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-133 THEN THE FIRST AND FOREMOST WHO HAD RESUMED HIS HAIRY BODY AND BEAR HEAD TURNED TO THE NOME AND ASKED, DO YOU STILL DEMAND OUR ASSISTANCE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-134 MORE THAN EVER ANSWERED THE GENERAL FIRMLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-135 THEN TELL ME, WHAT CAN YOU OFFER THE PHANFASMS THAT THEY HAVE NOT ALREADY?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-136 INQUIRED THE FIRST AND FOREMOST.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-137 GUPH HESITATED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-138 HE REALLY DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO SAY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-139 THE NOME KING'S VAUNTED MAGIC BELT SEEMED A POOR THING COMPARED TO THE ASTONISHING MAGICAL POWERS OF THESE PEOPLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-140 GOLD JEWELS AND SLAVES THEY MIGHT SECURE IN ANY QUANTITY WITHOUT ESPECIAL EFFORT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-141 HE FELT THAT HE WAS DEALING WITH POWERS GREATLY BEYOND HIM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-142 THERE WAS BUT ONE ARGUMENT THAT MIGHT INFLUENCE THE PHANFASMS WHO WERE CREATURES OF EVIL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-143 PERMIT ME TO CALL YOUR ATTENTION TO THE EXQUISITE JOY OF MAKING THE HAPPY UNHAPPY SAID HE AT LAST.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-144 CONSIDER THE PLEASURE OF DESTROYING INNOCENT AND HARMLESS PEOPLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-145 AH!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-146 YOU HAVE ANSWERED ME CRIED THE FIRST AND FOREMOST.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-147 FOR THAT REASON ALONE WE WILL AID YOU.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-148 GO HOME AND TELL YOUR BANDY LEGGED KING THAT AS SOON AS HIS TUNNEL IS FINISHED THE PHANFASMS WILL BE WITH HIM AND LEAD HIS LEGIONS TO THE CONQUEST OF OZ. THE DEADLY DESERT ALONE HAS KEPT US FROM DESTROYING OZ LONG AGO AND YOUR UNDERGROUND TUNNEL IS A CLEVER THOUGHT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-149 GO HOME AND PREPARE FOR OUR COMING!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-150 GUPH WAS VERY GLAD TO BE PERMITTED TO GO WITH THIS PROMISE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-151 THE OWL MAN LED HIM BACK DOWN THE MOUNTAIN PATH AND ORDERED THE SCARLET ALLIGATOR TO CRAWL AWAY AND ALLOW THE NOME TO CROSS THE BRIDGE IN SAFETY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-152 AFTER THE VISITOR HAD GONE A BRILLIANT AND GORGEOUS CITY APPEARED UPON THE MOUNTAIN TOP CLEARLY VISIBLE TO THE EYES OF THE GAILY DRESSED MULTITUDE OF PHANFASMS THAT LIVED THERE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-153 AND THE FIRST AND FOREMOST BEAUTIFULLY ARRAYED ADDRESSED THE OTHERS IN THESE WORDS, IT IS TIME WE WENT INTO THE WORLD AND BROUGHT SORROW AND DISMAY TO ITS PEOPLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-154 TOO LONG HAVE WE REMAINED FOR OURSELVES UPON THIS MOUNTAIN TOP FOR WHILE WE ARE THUS SECLUDED MANY NATIONS HAVE GROWN HAPPY AND PROSPEROUS AND THE CHIEF JOY OF THE RACE OF PHANFASMS IS TO DESTROY HAPPINESS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-155 SO I THINK IT IS LUCKY THAT THIS MESSENGER FROM THE NOMES ARRIVED AMONG US JUST NOW TO REMIND US THAT THE OPPORTUNITY HAS COME FOR US TO MAKE TROUBLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-156 WE WILL USE KING ROQUAT'S TUNNEL TO CONQUER THE LAND OF OZ. THEN WE WILL DESTROY THE WHIMSIES THE GROWLEYWOGS AND THE NOMES AND AFTERWARD GO OUT TO RAVAGE AND ANNOY AND GRIEVE THE WHOLE WORLD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-157 THE MULTITUDE OF EVIL PHANFASMS EAGERLY APPLAUDED THIS PLAN WHICH THEY FULLY APPROVED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-11-158 I AM TOLD THAT THE ERBS ARE THE MOST POWERFUL AND MERCILESS OF ALL THE EVIL SPIRITS AND THE PHANFASMS OF PHANTASTICO BELONG TO THE RACE OF ERBS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-01 CHAPTER TWELVE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-02 HOW THEY MATCHED THE FUDDLES DOROTHY AND HER FELLOW TRAVELERS RODE AWAY FROM THE CUTTENCLIP VILLAGE AND FOLLOWED THE INDISTINCT PATH AS FAR AS THE SIGN POST.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-03 HERE THEY TOOK THE MAIN ROAD AGAIN AND PROCEEDED PLEASANTLY THROUGH THE PRETTY FARMING COUNTRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-04 WHEN EVENING CAME THEY STOPPED AT A DWELLING AND WERE JOYFULLY WELCOMED AND GIVEN PLENTY TO EAT AND GOOD BEDS FOR THE NIGHT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-05 EARLY NEXT MORNING HOWEVER THEY WERE UP AND EAGER TO START AND AFTER A GOOD BREAKFAST THEY BADE THEIR HOST GOOD BYE AND CLIMBED INTO THE RED WAGON TO WHICH THE SAWHORSE HAD BEEN HITCHED ALL NIGHT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-06 BEING MADE OF WOOD THIS HORSE NEVER GOT TIRED NOR CARED TO LIE DOWN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-07 DOROTHY WAS NOT QUITE SURE WHETHER HE EVER SLEPT OR NOT BUT IT WAS CERTAIN THAT HE NEVER DID WHEN ANYBODY WAS AROUND.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-08 THE WEATHER IS ALWAYS BEAUTIFUL IN OZ AND THIS MORNING THE AIR WAS COOL AND REFRESHING AND THE SUNSHINE BRILLIANT AND DELIGHTFUL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-09 IN ABOUT AN HOUR THEY CAME TO A PLACE WHERE ANOTHER ROAD BRANCHED OFF.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-10 THERE WAS A SIGN POST HERE WHICH READ, THIS WAY TO FUDDLECUMJIG OH HERE IS WHERE WE TURN SAID DOROTHY OBSERVING THE SIGN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-11 WHAT!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-12 ARE WE GOING TO FUDDLECUMJIG?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-13 ASKED THE CAPTAIN GENERAL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-14 YES,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-15 OZMA THOUGHT WE MIGHT ENJOY THE FUDDLES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-16 THEY ARE SAID TO BE VERY INTERESTING SHE REPLIED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-17 NO ONE WOULD SUSPECT IT FROM THEIR NAME SAID AUNT EM. WHO ARE THEY ANYHOW?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-18 MORE PAPER THINGS?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-19 I THINK NOT ANSWERED DOROTHY LAUGHING,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-20 BUT I CAN'T SAY ZACTLY AUNT EM WHAT THEY ARE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-21 WE'LL FIND OUT WHEN WE GET THERE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-22 PERHAPS THE WIZARD KNOWS SUGGESTED UNCLE HENRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-23 NO,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-24 I'VE NEVER BEEN THERE BEFORE SAID THE WIZARD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-25 BUT I'VE OFTEN HEARD OF FUDDLECUMJIG AND THE FUDDLES WHO ARE SAID TO BE THE MOST PECULIAR PEOPLE IN ALL THE LAND OF OZ. IN WHAT WAY?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-26 ASKED THE SHAGGY MAN. I DON'T KNOW I'M SURE SAID THE WIZARD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-27 JUST THEN AS THEY RODE ALONG THE PRETTY GREEN LANE TOWARD FUDDLECUMJIG THEY ESPIED A KANGAROO SITTING BY THE ROADSIDE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-28 THE POOR ANIMAL HAD ITS FACE COVERED WITH BOTH ITS FRONT PAWS AND WAS CRYING SO BITTERLY THAT THE TEARS COURSED DOWN ITS CHEEKS IN TWO TINY STREAMS AND TRICKLED ACROSS THE ROAD WHERE THEY FORMED A POOL IN A SMALL HOLLOW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-29 THE SAWHORSE STOPPED SHORT AT THIS PITIFUL SIGHT AND DOROTHY CRIED OUT WITH READY SYMPATHY, WHAT'S THE MATTER KANGAROO?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-30 BOO HOO!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-31 BOO HOO!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-32 WAILED THE KANGAROO,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-33 I'VE LOST MY MI MI MI OH BOO HOO!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-34 BOO HOO!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-35 POOR THING SAID THE WIZARD SHE'S LOST HER MISTER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-36 IT'S PROBABLY HER HUSBAND AND HE'S DEAD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-37 NO NO NO!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-38 SOBBED THE KANGAROO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-39 IT IT ISN'T THAT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-40 I'VE LOST MY MI MI OH BOO BOO HOO!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-41 I KNOW SAID THE SHAGGY MAN,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-42 SHE'S LOST HER MIRROR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-43 NO,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-44 THE KANGAROO CRIED HARDER THAN EVER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-45 IT MUST BE HER MINCE PIE SUGGESTED AUNT EM. OR HER MILK TOAST PROPOSED UNCLE HENRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-46 I'VE LOST MY MI MI MITTENS!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-47 SAID THE KANGAROO GETTING IT OUT AT LAST.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-48 OH!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-49 CRIED THE YELLOW HEN WITH A CACKLE OF RELIEF.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-50 WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SO BEFORE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-51 BOO HOO!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-52 I I COULDN'T ANSWERED THE KANGAROO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-53 BUT SEE HERE SAID DOROTHY YOU DON'T NEED MITTENS IN THIS WARM WEATHER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-54 YES INDEED I DO REPLIED THE ANIMAL STOPPING HER SOBS AND REMOVING HER PAWS FROM HER FACE TO LOOK AT THE LITTLE GIRL REPROACHFULLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-55 MY HANDS WILL GET ALL SUNBURNED AND TANNED WITHOUT MY MITTENS AND I'VE WORN THEM SO LONG THAT I'LL PROBABLY CATCH COLD WITHOUT THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-56 NONSENSE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-57 SAID DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-58 I NEVER HEARD OF ANY KANGAROO WEARING MITTENS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-59 DIDN'T YOU?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-60 ASKED THE ANIMAL AS IF SURPRISED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-61 NEVER!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-62 REPEATED THE GIRL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-63 AND YOU'LL PROBABLY MAKE YOURSELF SICK IF YOU DON'T STOP CRYING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-64 WHERE DO YOU LIVE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-65 ABOUT TWO MILES BEYOND FUDDLECUMJIG WAS THE ANSWER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-66 GRANDMOTHER GNIT MADE ME THE MITTENS AND SHE'S ONE OF THE FUDDLES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-67 WELL YOU'D BETTER GO HOME NOW AND PERHAPS THE OLD LADY WILL MAKE YOU ANOTHER PAIR SUGGESTED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-68 WE'RE ON OUR WAY TO FUDDLECUMJIG AND YOU MAY HOP ALONG BESIDE US.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-69 SO THEY RODE ON AND THE KANGAROO HOPPED BESIDE THE RED WAGON AND SEEMED QUICKLY TO HAVE FORGOTTEN HER LOSS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-70 BY AND BY THE WIZARD SAID TO THE ANIMAL, ARE THE FUDDLES NICE PEOPLE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-71 OH VERY NICE ANSWERED THE KANGAROO,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-72 THAT IS WHEN THEY'RE PROPERLY PUT TOGETHER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-73 BUT THEY GET DREADFULLY SCATTERED AND MIXED UP AT TIMES AND THEN YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING WITH THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-74 WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THEIR GETTING SCATTERED?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-75 INQUIRED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-76 WHY THEY'RE MADE IN A GOOD MANY SMALL PIECES EXPLAINED THE KANGAROO,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-77 AND WHENEVER ANY STRANGER COMES NEAR THEM THEY HAVE A HABIT OF FALLING APART AND SCATTERING THEMSELVES AROUND.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-78 THAT'S WHEN THEY GET SO DREADFULLY MIXED AND IT'S A HARD PUZZLE TO PUT THEM TOGETHER AGAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-79 WHO USUALLY PUTS THEM TOGETHER?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-80 ASKED OMBY AMBY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-81 ANY ONE WHO IS ABLE TO MATCH THE PIECES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-82 I SOMETIMES PUT GRANDMOTHER GNIT TOGETHER MYSELF BECAUSE I KNOW HER SO WELL I CAN TELL EVERY PIECE THAT BELONGS TO HER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-83 THEN WHEN SHE'S ALL MATCHED SHE KNITS FOR ME AND THAT'S HOW SHE MADE MY MITTENS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-84 BUT IT TOOK A GOOD MANY DAYS HARD KNITTING AND I HAD TO PUT GRANDMOTHER TOGETHER A GOOD MANY TIMES BECAUSE EVERY TIME I CAME NEAR SHE'D SCATTER HERSELF.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-85 I SHOULD THINK SHE WOULD GET USED TO YOUR COMING AND NOT BE AFRAID SAID DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-86 IT ISN'T THAT REPLIED THE KANGAROO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-87 THEY'RE NOT A BIT AFRAID WHEN THEY'RE PUT TOGETHER AND USUALLY THEY'RE VERY JOLLY AND PLEASANT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-88 IT'S JUST A HABIT THEY HAVE TO SCATTER THEMSELVES AND IF THEY DIDN'T DO IT THEY WOULDN'T BE FUDDLES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-89 THE TRAVELERS THOUGHT UPON THIS QUITE SERIOUSLY FOR A TIME WHILE THE SAWHORSE CONTINUED TO CARRY THEM RAPIDLY FORWARD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-90 THEN AUNT EM REMARKED, I DON'T SEE MUCH USE OUR VISITIN THESE FUDDLES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-91 IF WE FIND THEM SCATTERED ALL WE CAN DO IS TO SWEEP EM UP AND THEN GO ABOUT OUR BUSINESS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-92 OH I B'LIEVE WE'D BETTER GO ON REPLIED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-93 I'M GETTING HUNGRY AND WE MUST TRY TO GET SOME LUNCHEON AT FUDDLECUMJIG.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-94 PERHAPS THE FOOD WON'T BE SCATTERED AS BADLY AS THE PEOPLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-95 YOU'LL FIND PLENTY TO EAT THERE DECLARED THE KANGAROO HOPPING ALONG IN BIG BOUNDS BECAUSE THE SAWHORSE WAS GOING SO FAST,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-96 AND THEY HAVE A FINE COOK TOO IF YOU CAN MANAGE TO PUT HIM TOGETHER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-97 THERE'S THE TOWN NOW JUST AHEAD OF US!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-98 THEY LOOKED AHEAD AND SAW A GROUP OF VERY PRETTY HOUSES STANDING IN A GREEN FIELD A LITTLE APART FROM THE MAIN ROAD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-99 SOME MUNCHKINS CAME HERE A FEW DAYS AGO AND MATCHED A LOT OF PEOPLE TOGETHER SAID THE KANGAROO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-100 I THINK THEY ARE TOGETHER YET AND IF YOU GO SOFTLY WITHOUT MAKING ANY NOISE PERHAPS THEY WON'T SCATTER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-101 LET'S TRY IT SUGGESTED THE WIZARD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-102 SO THEY STOPPED THE SAWHORSE AND GOT OUT OF THE WAGON AND AFTER BIDDING GOOD BYE TO THE KANGAROO WHO HOPPED AWAY HOME THEY ENTERED THE FIELD AND VERY CAUTIOUSLY APPROACHED THE GROUP OF HOUSES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-103 SO SILENTLY DID THEY MOVE THAT SOON THEY SAW THROUGH THE WINDOWS OF THE HOUSES PEOPLE MOVING AROUND WHILE OTHERS WERE PASSING TO AND FRO IN THE YARDS BETWEEN THE BUILDINGS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-104 THEY SEEMED MUCH LIKE OTHER PEOPLE FROM A DISTANCE AND APPARENTLY THEY DID NOT NOTICE THE LITTLE PARTY SO QUIETLY APPROACHING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-105 THEY HAD ALMOST REACHED THE NEAREST HOUSE WHEN TOTO SAW A LARGE BEETLE CROSSING THE PATH AND BARKED LOUDLY AT IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-106 INSTANTLY A WILD CLATTER WAS HEARD FROM THE HOUSES AND YARDS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-107 DOROTHY THOUGHT IT SOUNDED LIKE A SUDDEN HAILSTORM AND THE VISITORS KNOWING THAT CAUTION WAS NO LONGER NECESSARY HURRIED FORWARD TO SEE WHAT HAD HAPPENED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-108 AFTER THE CLATTER AN INTENSE STILLNESS REIGNED IN THE TOWN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-109 THE STRANGERS ENTERED THE FIRST HOUSE THEY CAME TO WHICH WAS ALSO THE LARGEST AND FOUND THE FLOOR STREWN WITH PIECES OF THE PEOPLE WHO LIVED THERE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-110 THEY LOOKED MUCH LIKE FRAGMENTS OF WOOD NEATLY PAINTED AND WERE OF ALL SORTS OF CURIOUS AND FANTASTIC SHAPES NO TWO PIECES BEING IN ANY WAY ALIKE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-111 THEY PICKED UP SOME OF THESE PIECES AND LOOKED AT THEM CAREFULLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-112 ON ONE WHICH DOROTHY HELD WAS AN EYE WHICH LOOKED AT HER PLEASANTLY BUT WITH AN INTERESTED EXPRESSION AS IF IT WONDERED WHAT SHE WAS GOING TO DO WITH IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-113 QUITE NEAR BY SHE DISCOVERED AND PICKED UP A NOSE AND BY MATCHING THE TWO PIECES TOGETHER FOUND THAT THEY WERE PART OF A FACE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-114 IF I COULD FIND THE MOUTH SHE SAID THIS FUDDLE MIGHT BE ABLE TO TALK AND TELL US WHAT TO DO NEXT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-115 THEN LET US FIND IT REPLIED THE WIZARD AND SO ALL GOT DOWN ON THEIR HANDS AND KNEES AND BEGAN EXAMINING THE SCATTERED PIECES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-116 I'VE FOUND IT!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-117 CRIED THE SHAGGY MAN AND RAN TO DOROTHY WITH A QUEER SHAPED PIECE THAT HAD A MOUTH ON IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-118 BUT WHEN THEY TRIED TO FIT IT TO THE EYE AND NOSE THEY FOUND THE PARTS WOULDN'T MATCH TOGETHER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-119 THAT MOUTH BELONGS TO SOME OTHER PERSON SAID DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-120 YOU SEE WE NEED A CURVE HERE AND A POINT THERE TO MAKE IT FIT THE FACE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-121 WELL IT MUST BE HERE SOME PLACE DECLARED THE WIZARD,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-122 SO IF WE SEARCH LONG ENOUGH WE SHALL FIND IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-123 DOROTHY FITTED AN EAR ON NEXT AND THE EAR HAD A LITTLE PATCH OF RED HAIR ABOVE IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-124 SO WHILE THE OTHERS WERE SEARCHING FOR THE MOUTH SHE HUNTED FOR PIECES WITH RED HAIR AND FOUND SEVERAL OF THEM WHICH WHEN MATCHED TO THE OTHER PIECES FORMED THE TOP OF A MAN'S HEAD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-125 SHE HAD ALSO FOUND THE OTHER EYE AND THE EAR BY THE TIME OMBY AMBY IN A FAR CORNER DISCOVERED THE MOUTH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-126 WHEN THE FACE WAS THUS COMPLETED ALL THE PARTS JOINED TOGETHER WITH A NICETY THAT WAS ASTONISHING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-127 WHY IT'S LIKE A PICTURE PUZZLE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-128 EXCLAIMED THE LITTLE GIRL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-129 LET'S FIND THE REST OF HIM AND GET HIM ALL TOGETHER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-130 WHAT'S THE REST OF HIM LIKE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-131 ASKED THE WIZARD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-132 HERE ARE SOME PIECES OF BLUE LEGS AND GREEN ARMS BUT I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THEY ARE HIS OR NOT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-133 LOOK FOR A WHITE SHIRT AND A WHITE APRON SAID THE HEAD WHICH HAD BEEN PUT TOGETHER SPEAKING IN A RATHER FAINT VOICE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-134 I'M THE COOK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-135 OH THANK YOU SAID DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-136 IT'S LUCKY WE STARTED YOU FIRST FOR I'M HUNGRY AND YOU CAN BE COOKING SOMETHING FOR US TO EAT WHILE WE MATCH THE OTHER FOLKS TOGETHER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-137 IT WAS NOT SO VERY DIFFICULT NOW THAT THEY HAD A HINT AS TO HOW THE MAN WAS DRESSED TO FIND THE OTHER PIECES BELONGING TO HIM AND AS ALL OF THEM NOW WORKED ON THE COOK TRYING PIECE AFTER PIECE TO SEE IF IT WOULD FIT THEY FINALLY HAD THE COOK SET UP COMPLETE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-138 WHEN HE WAS FINISHED HE MADE THEM A LOW BOW AND SAID, I WILL GO AT ONCE TO THE KITCHEN TO PREPARE YOUR DINNER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-139 YOU WILL FIND IT SOMETHING OF A JOB TO GET ALL THE FUDDLES TOGETHER SO I ADVISE YOU TO BEGIN ON THE LORD HIGH CHIGGLEWITZ WHOSE FIRST NAME IS LARRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-140 A PIECE OF HIS LEFT KNEE IS MISSING HAVING BEEN LOST YEARS AGO WHEN HE SCATTERED HIMSELF TOO CARELESSLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-141 THAT MAKES HIM LIMP A LITTLE BUT HE GETS ALONG VERY WELL WITH HALF A KNEE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-142 AS HE IS THE CHIEF PERSONAGE IN THIS TOWN OF FUDDLECUMJIG HE WILL BE ABLE TO WELCOME YOU AND ASSIST YOU WITH THE OTHERS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-143 SO IT WILL BE BEST TO WORK ON HIM WHILE I'M GETTING YOUR DINNER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-144 WE WILL SAID THE WIZARD,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-145 AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH COOK FOR THE SUGGESTION.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-146 AUNT EM WAS THE FIRST TO DISCOVER A PIECE OF THE LORD HIGH CHIGGLEWITZ.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-147 IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE A FOOL BUSINESS THIS MATCHING FOLKS TOGETHER SHE REMARKED,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-148 BUT AS WE HAVEN'T ANYTHING TO DO TILL DINNER'S READY WE MAY AS WELL GET RID OF SOME OF THIS RUBBISH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-149 HERE HENRY GET BUSY AND LOOK FOR LARRY'S BALD HEAD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-150 I'VE GOT HIS PINK VEST ALL RIGHT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-151 THEY WORKED WITH EAGER INTEREST AND BILLINA PROVED A GREAT HELP TO THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-152 THE YELLOW HEN HAD SHARP EYES AND COULD PUT HER HEAD CLOSE TO THE VARIOUS PIECES THAT LAY SCATTERED AROUND.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-153 SHE WOULD EXAMINE THE LORD HIGH CHIGGLEWITZ AND SEE WHICH PIECE OF HIM WAS NEXT NEEDED AND THEN HUNT AROUND UNTIL SHE FOUND IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-154 SO BEFORE AN HOUR HAD PASSED OLD LARRY WAS STANDING COMPLETE BEFORE THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-155 I CONGRATULATE YOU MY FRIENDS HE SAID SPEAKING IN A CHEERFUL VOICE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-156 YOU ARE CERTAINLY THE CLEVEREST PEOPLE WHO EVER VISITED US.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-157 I WAS NEVER MATCHED TOGETHER SO QUICKLY IN MY LIFE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-158 I'M CONSIDERED A GREAT PUZZLE USUALLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-159 WELL SAID DOROTHY THERE USED TO BE A PICTURE PUZZLE CRAZE IN KANSAS AND SO I'VE HAD SOME SPERIENCE MATCHING PUZZLES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-160 BUT THE PICTURES WERE FLAT WHILE YOU ARE ROUND AND THAT MAKES YOU HARDER TO FIGURE OUT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-161 THANK YOU MY DEAR REPLIED OLD LARRY GREATLY PLEASED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-162 I FEEL HIGHLY COMPLIMENTED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-163 WERE I NOT A REALLY GOOD PUZZLE THERE WOULD BE NO OBJECT IN MY SCATTERING MYSELF.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-164 WHY DO YOU DO IT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-165 ASKED AUNT EM SEVERELY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-166 WHY DON'T YOU BEHAVE YOURSELF AND STAY PUT TOGETHER?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-167 THE LORD HIGH CHIGGLEWITZ SEEMED ANNOYED BY THIS SPEECH,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-168 BUT HE REPLIED POLITELY, MADAM YOU HAVE PERHAPS NOTICED THAT EVERY PERSON HAS SOME PECULIARITY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-169 MINE IS TO SCATTER MYSELF.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-170 WHAT YOUR OWN PECULIARITY IS I WILL NOT VENTURE TO SAY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-171 BUT I SHALL NEVER FIND FAULT WITH YOU WHATEVER YOU DO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-172 NOW YOU'VE GOT YOUR DIPLOMA EM SAID UNCLE HENRY WITH A LAUGH AND I'M GLAD OF IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-173 THIS IS A QUEER COUNTRY AND WE MAY AS WELL TAKE PEOPLE AS WE FIND THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-174 IF WE DID WE'D LEAVE THESE FOLKS SCATTERED SHE RETURNED AND THIS RETORT MADE EVERYBODY LAUGH GOOD NATUREDLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-175 JUST THEN OMBY AMBY FOUND A HAND WITH A KNITTING NEEDLE IN IT AND THEY DECIDED TO PUT GRANDMOTHER GNIT TOGETHER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-176 SHE PROVED AN EASIER PUZZLE THAN OLD LARRY AND WHEN SHE WAS COMPLETED THEY FOUND HER A PLEASANT OLD LADY WHO WELCOMED THEM CORDIALLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-177 DOROTHY TOLD HER HOW THE KANGAROO HAD LOST HER MITTENS AND GRANDMOTHER GNIT PROMISED TO SET TO WORK AT ONCE AND MAKE THE POOR ANIMAL ANOTHER PAIR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-178 THEN THE COOK CAME TO CALL THEM TO DINNER AND THEY FOUND AN INVITING MEAL PREPARED FOR THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-179 THE LORD HIGH CHIGGLEWITZ SAT AT THE HEAD OF THE TABLE AND GRANDMOTHER GNIT AT THE FOOT AND THE GUESTS HAD A MERRY TIME AND THOROUGHLY ENJOYED THEMSELVES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-180 AFTER DINNER THEY WENT OUT INTO THE YARD AND MATCHED SEVERAL OTHER PEOPLE TOGETHER AND THIS WORK WAS SO INTERESTING THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE SPENT THE ENTIRE DAY AT FUDDLECUMJIG HAD NOT THE WIZARD SUGGESTED THAT THEY RESUME THEIR JOURNEY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-181 BUT I DON'T LIKE TO LEAVE ALL THESE POOR PEOPLE SCATTERED SAID DOROTHY UNDECIDED WHAT TO DO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-182 OH DON'T MIND US MY DEAR RETURNED OLD LARRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-183 EVERY DAY OR SO SOME OF THE GILLIKINS OR MUNCHKINS OR WINKIES COME HERE TO AMUSE THEMSELVES BY MATCHING US TOGETHER SO THERE WILL BE NO HARM IN LEAVING THESE PIECES WHERE THEY ARE FOR A TIME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-184 BUT I HOPE YOU WILL VISIT US AGAIN AND IF YOU DO YOU WILL ALWAYS BE WELCOME I ASSURE YOU.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-185 DON'T YOU EVER MATCH EACH OTHER?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-186 SHE INQUIRED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-187 NEVER,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-188 FOR WE ARE NO PUZZLES TO OURSELVES AND SO THERE WOULDN'T BE ANY FUN IN IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-189 THEY NOW SAID GOODBYE TO THE QUEER FUDDLES AND GOT INTO THEIR WAGON TO CONTINUE THEIR JOURNEY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-190 THOSE ARE CERTAINLY STRANGE PEOPLE REMARKED AUNT EM THOUGHTFULLY AS THEY DROVE AWAY FROM FUDDLECUMJIG BUT I REALLY CAN'T SEE WHAT USE THEY ARE AT ALL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-191 WHY THEY AMUSED US ALL FOR SEVERAL HOURS REPLIED THE WIZARD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-192 THAT IS BEING OF USE TO US I'M SURE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-193 I THINK THEY'RE MORE FUN THAN PLAYING SOLITAIRE OR MUMBLETYPEG DECLARED UNCLE HENRY SOBERLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-12-194 FOR MY PART I'M GLAD WE VISITED THE FUDDLES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-01 CHAPTER THIRTEEN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-02 HOW THE GENERAL TALKED TO THE KING WHEN GENERAL GUPH RETURNED TO THE CAVERN OF THE NOME KING HIS MAJESTY ASKED, WELL WHAT LUCK?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-03 WILL THE WHIMSIES JOIN US?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-04 THEY WILL ANSWERED THE GENERAL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-05 THEY WILL FIGHT FOR US WITH ALL THEIR STRENGTH AND CUNNING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-06 GOOD!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-07 EXCLAIMED THE KING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-08 WHAT REWARD DID YOU PROMISE THEM?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-09 YOUR MAJESTY IS TO USE THE MAGIC BELT TO GIVE EACH WHIMSIE A LARGE FINE HEAD IN PLACE OF THE SMALL ONE HE IS NOW OBLIGED TO WEAR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-10 I AGREE TO THAT SAID THE KING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-11 THIS IS GOOD NEWS GUPH AND IT MAKES ME FEEL MORE CERTAIN OF THE CONQUEST OF OZ. BUT I HAVE OTHER NEWS FOR YOU ANNOUNCED THE GENERAL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-12 GOOD OR BAD?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-13 GOOD YOUR MAJESTY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-14 THEN I WILL HEAR IT SAID THE KING WITH INTEREST.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-15 THE GROWLEYWOGS WILL JOIN US.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-16 NO!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-17 CRIED THE ASTONISHED KING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-18 YES INDEED SAID THE GENERAL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-19 I HAVE THEIR PROMISE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-20 BUT WHAT REWARD DO THEY DEMAND?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-21 INQUIRED THE KING SUSPICIOUSLY FOR HE KNEW HOW GREEDY THE GROWLEYWOGS WERE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-22 THEY ARE TO TAKE A FEW OF THE OZ PEOPLE FOR THEIR SLAVES REPLIED GUPH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-23 HE DID NOT THINK IT NECESSARY TO TELL ROQUAT THAT THE GROWLEYWOGS DEMANDED TWENTY THOUSAND SLAVES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-24 IT WOULD BE TIME ENOUGH FOR THAT WHEN OZ WAS CONQUERED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-25 A VERY REASONABLE REQUEST I'M SURE REMARKED THE KING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-26 I MUST CONGRATULATE YOU GUPH UPON THE WONDERFUL SUCCESS OF YOUR JOURNEY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-27 BUT THAT IS NOT ALL SAID THE GENERAL PROUDLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-28 THE KING SEEMED ASTONISHED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-29 SPEAK OUT SIR!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-30 HE COMMANDED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-31 I HAVE SEEN THE FIRST AND FOREMOST PHANFASM OF THE MOUNTAIN OF PHANTASTICO AND HE WILL BRING HIS PEOPLE TO ASSIST US.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-32 WHAT!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-33 CRIED THE KING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-34 THE PHANFASMS!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-35 YOU DON'T MEAN IT GUPH!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-36 IT IS TRUE DECLARED THE GENERAL PROUDLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-37 THE KING BECAME THOUGHTFUL AND HIS BROWS WRINKLED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-38 I'M AFRAID GUPH HE SAID RATHER ANXIOUSLY THAT THE FIRST AND FOREMOST MAY PROVE AS DANGEROUS TO US AS TO THE OZ PEOPLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-39 IF HE AND HIS TERRIBLE BAND COME DOWN FROM THE MOUNTAIN THEY MAY TAKE THE NOTION TO CONQUER THE NOMES!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-40 PAH!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-41 THAT IS A FOOLISH IDEA RETORTED GUPH IRRITABLY BUT HE KNEW IN HIS HEART THAT THE KING WAS RIGHT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-42 THE FIRST AND FOREMOST IS A PARTICULAR FRIEND OF MINE AND WILL DO US NO HARM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-43 WHY WHEN I WAS THERE HE EVEN INVITED ME INTO HIS HOUSE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-44 THE GENERAL NEGLECTED TO TELL THE KING HOW HE HAD BEEN JERKED INTO THE HUT OF THE FIRST AND FOREMOST BY MEANS OF THE BRASS HOOP.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-45 SO ROQUAT THE RED LOOKED AT HIS GENERAL ADMIRINGLY AND SAID, YOU ARE A WONDERFUL NOME GUPH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-46 I'M SORRY I DID NOT MAKE YOU MY GENERAL BEFORE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-47 BUT WHAT REWARD DID THE FIRST AND FOREMOST DEMAND?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-48 NOTHING AT ALL ANSWERED GUPH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-49 EVEN THE MAGIC BELT ITSELF COULD NOT ADD TO HIS POWERS OF SORCERY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-50 ALL THE PHANFASMS WISH IS TO DESTROY THE OZ PEOPLE WHO ARE GOOD AND HAPPY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-51 THIS PLEASURE WILL AMPLY REPAY THEM FOR ASSISTING US.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-52 WHEN WILL THEY COME?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-53 ASKED ROQUAT HALF FEARFULLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-54 WHEN THE TUNNEL IS COMPLETED SAID THE GENERAL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-55 WE ARE NEARLY HALFWAY UNDER THE DESERT NOW ANNOUNCED THE KING,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-56 AND THAT IS FAST WORK BECAUSE THE TUNNEL HAS TO BE DRILLED THROUGH SOLID ROCK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-57 BUT AFTER WE HAVE PASSED THE DESERT IT WILL NOT TAKE US LONG TO EXTEND THE TUNNEL TO THE WALLS OF THE EMERALD CITY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-58 WELL WHENEVER YOU ARE READY WE SHALL BE JOINED BY THE WHIMSIES THE GROWLEYWOGS AND THE PHANFASMS SAID GUPH,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-59 SO THE CONQUEST OF OZ IS ASSURED WITHOUT A DOUBT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-60 AGAIN THE KING SEEMED THOUGHTFUL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-61 I'M ALMOST SORRY WE DID NOT UNDERTAKE THE CONQUEST ALONE SAID HE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-62 ALL OF THESE ALLIES ARE DANGEROUS PEOPLE AND THEY MAY DEMAND MORE THAN YOU HAVE PROMISED THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-63 IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN BETTER TO HAVE CONQUERED OZ WITHOUT ANY OUTSIDE ASSISTANCE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-64 WE COULD NOT DO IT SAID THE GENERAL POSITIVELY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-65 WHY NOT GUPH?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-66 YOU KNOW VERY WELL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-67 YOU HAVE HAD ONE EXPERIENCE WITH THE OZ PEOPLE AND THEY DEFEATED YOU.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-68 THAT WAS BECAUSE THEY ROLLED EGGS AT US REPLIED THE KING WITH A SHUDDER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-69 MY NOMES CANNOT STAND EGGS ANY MORE THAN I CAN MYSELF.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-70 THEY ARE POISON TO ALL WHO LIVE UNDERGROUND.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-71 THAT IS TRUE ENOUGH AGREED GUPH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-72 BUT WE MIGHT HAVE TAKEN THE OZ PEOPLE BY SURPRISE AND CONQUERED THEM BEFORE THEY HAD A CHANCE TO GET ANY EGGS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-73 OUR FORMER DEFEAT WAS DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE GIRL DOROTHY HAD A YELLOW HEN WITH HER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-74 I DO NOT KNOW WHAT EVER BECAME OF THAT HEN BUT I BELIEVE THERE ARE NO HENS AT ALL IN THE LAND OF OZ AND SO THERE COULD BE NO EGGS THERE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-75 ON THE CONTRARY SAID GUPH THERE ARE NOW HUNDREDS OF CHICKENS IN OZ AND THEY LAY HEAPS OF THOSE DANGEROUS EGGS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-76 I MET A GOSHAWK ON MY WAY HOME AND THE BIRD INFORMED ME THAT HE HAD LATELY BEEN TO OZ TO CAPTURE AND DEVOUR SOME OF THE YOUNG CHICKENS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-77 BUT THEY ARE PROTECTED BY MAGIC SO THE HAWK DID NOT GET A SINGLE ONE OF THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-78 THAT IS A VERY BAD REPORT SAID THE KING NERVOUSLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-79 VERY BAD INDEED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-80 MY NOMES ARE WILLING TO FIGHT BUT THEY SIMPLY CAN'T FACE HEN'S EGGS AND I DON'T BLAME THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-81 THEY WON'T NEED TO FACE THEM REPLIED GUPH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-82 I'M AFRAID OF EGGS MYSELF AND DON'T PROPOSE TO TAKE ANY CHANCES OF BEING POISONED BY THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-83 MY PLAN IS TO SEND THE WHIMSIES THROUGH THE TUNNEL FIRST AND THEN THE GROWLEYWOGS AND THE PHANFASMS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-84 BY THE TIME WE NOMES GET THERE THE EGGS WILL ALL BE USED UP AND WE MAY THEN PURSUE AND CAPTURE THE INHABITANTS AT OUR LEISURE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-85 PERHAPS YOU ARE RIGHT RETURNED THE KING WITH A DISMAL SIGH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-86 BUT I WANT IT DISTINCTLY UNDERSTOOD THAT I CLAIM OZMA AND DOROTHY AS MY OWN PRISONERS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-87 THEY ARE RATHER NICE GIRLS AND I DO NOT INTEND TO LET ANY OF THOSE DREADFUL CREATURES HURT THEM OR MAKE THEM THEIR SLAVES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-88 WHEN I HAVE CAPTURED THEM I WILL BRING THEM HERE AND TRANSFORM THEM INTO CHINA ORNAMENTS TO STAND ON MY MANTLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-89 THEY WILL LOOK VERY PRETTY DOROTHY ON ONE END OF THE MANTLE AND OZMA ON THE OTHER AND I SHALL TAKE GREAT CARE TO SEE THEY ARE NOT BROKEN WHEN THE MAIDS DUST THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-90 VERY WELL YOUR MAJESTY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-91 DO WHAT YOU WILL WITH THE GIRLS FOR ALL I CARE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-92 NOW THAT OUR PLANS ARE ARRANGED AND WE HAVE THE THREE MOST POWERFUL BANDS OF EVIL SPIRITS IN THE WORLD TO ASSIST US LET US MAKE HASTE TO GET THE TUNNEL FINISHED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-13-93 IT WILL BE READY IN THREE DAYS PROMISED THE KING AND HURRIED AWAY TO INSPECT THE WORK AND SEE THAT THE NOMES KEPT BUSY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-01 CHAPTER FOURTEEN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-02 HOW THE WIZARD PRACTICED SORCERY WHERE NEXT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-03 ASKED THE WIZARD WHEN THEY HAD LEFT THE TOWN OF FUDDLECUMJIG AND THE SAWHORSE HAD STARTED BACK ALONG THE ROAD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-04 WHY OZMA LAID OUT THIS TRIP REPLIED DOROTHY AND SHE VISED US TO SEE THE RIGMAROLES NEXT AND THEN VISIT THE TIN WOODMAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-05 THAT SOUNDS GOOD SAID THE WIZARD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-06 BUT WHAT ROAD DO WE TAKE TO GET TO THE RIGMAROLES?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-07 I DON'T KNOW ZACTLY RETURNED THE LITTLE GIRL,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-08 BUT IT MUST BE SOMEWHERE JUST SOUTHWEST FROM HERE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-09 THEN WHY NEED WE GO WAY BACK TO THE CROSSROADS?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-10 ASKED THE SHAGGY MAN. WE MIGHT SAVE A LOT OF TIME BY BRANCHING OFF HERE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-11 THERE ISN'T ANY PATH ASSERTED UNCLE HENRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-12 THEN WE'D BETTER GO BACK TO THE SIGNPOSTS AND MAKE SURE OF OUR WAY DECIDED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-13 BUT AFTER THEY HAD GONE A SHORT DISTANCE FARTHER THE SAWHORSE WHO HAD OVERHEARD THEIR CONVERSATION STOPPED AND SAID, HERE IS A PATH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-14 SURE ENOUGH A DIM PATH SEEMED TO BRANCH OFF FROM THE ROAD THEY WERE ON AND IT LED ACROSS PRETTY GREEN MEADOWS AND PAST LEAFY GROVES STRAIGHT TOWARD THE SOUTHWEST.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-15 THAT LOOKS LIKE A GOOD PATH SAID OMBY AMBY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-16 WHY NOT TRY IT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-17 ALL RIGHT ANSWERED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-18 I'M ANXIOUS TO SEE WHAT THE RIGMAROLES ARE LIKE AND THIS PATH OUGHT TO TAKE US THERE THE QUICKEST WAY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-19 NO ONE MADE ANY OBJECTION TO THIS PLAN SO THE SAWHORSE TURNED INTO THE PATH WHICH PROVED TO BE NEARLY AS GOOD AS THE ONE THEY HAD TAKEN TO GET TO THE FUDDLES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-20 AS FIRST THEY PASSED A FEW RETIRED FARM HOUSES BUT SOON THESE SCATTERED DWELLINGS WERE LEFT BEHIND AND ONLY THE MEADOWS AND THE TREES WERE BEFORE THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-21 BUT THEY RODE ALONG IN CHEERFUL CONTENTMENT AND AUNT EM GOT INTO AN ARGUMENT WITH BILLINA ABOUT THE PROPER WAY TO RAISE CHICKENS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-22 I DO NOT CARE TO CONTRADICT YOU SAID THE YELLOW HEN WITH DIGNITY BUT I HAVE AN IDEA I KNOW MORE ABOUT CHICKENS THAN HUMAN BEINGS DO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-23 PSHAW!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-24 REPLIED AUNT EM. I'VE RAISED CHICKENS FOR NEARLY FORTY YEARS BILLINA AND I KNOW YOU'VE GOT TO STARVE EM TO MAKE EM LAY LOTS OF EGGS AND STUFF EM IF YOU WANT GOOD BROILERS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-25 EXCLAIMED BILLINA IN HORROR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-26 BROIL MY CHICKENS!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-27 WHY THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE FOR AIN'T IT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-28 ASKED AUNT EM ASTONISHED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-29 NO AUNT NOT IN OZ SAID DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-30 PEOPLE DO NOT EAT CHICKENS HERE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-31 YOU SEE BILLINA WAS THE FIRST HEN THAT WAS EVER SEEN IN THIS COUNTRY AND I BROUGHT HER HERE MYSELF.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-32 EVERYBODY LIKED HER AN RESPECTED HER SO THE OZ PEOPLE WOULDN'T ANY MORE EAT HER CHICKENS THAN THEY WOULD EAT BILLINA.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-33 WELL I DECLARE GASPED AUNT EM. HOW ABOUT THE EGGS?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-34 OH IF WE HAVE MORE EGGS THAN WE WANT TO HATCH WE ALLOW PEOPLE TO EAT THEM SAID BILLINA.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-35 INDEED I AM VERY GLAD THE OZ FOLKS LIKE OUR EGGS FOR OTHERWISE THEY WOULD SPOIL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-36 THIS CERTAINLY IS A QUEER COUNTRY SIGHED AUNT EM. EXCUSE ME CALLED THE SAWHORSE THE PATH HAS ENDED AND I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHICH WAY TO GO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-37 THEY LOOKED AROUND AND SURE ENOUGH THERE WAS NO PATH TO BE SEEN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-38 WELL SAID DOROTHY WE'RE GOING SOUTHWEST AND IT SEEMS JUST AS EASY TO FOLLOW THAT DIRECTION WITHOUT A PATH AS WITH ONE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-39 CERTAINLY ANSWERED THE SAWHORSE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-40 IT IS NOT HARD TO DRAW THE WAGON OVER THE MEADOW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-41 I ONLY WANT TO KNOW WHERE TO GO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-42 THERE'S A FOREST OVER THERE ACROSS THE PRAIRIE SAID THE WIZARD AND IT LIES IN THE DIRECTION WE ARE GOING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-43 MAKE STRAIGHT FOR THE FOREST SAWHORSE AND YOU'RE BOUND TO GO RIGHT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-44 SO THE WOODEN ANIMAL TROTTED ON AGAIN AND THE MEADOW GRASS WAS SO SOFT UNDER THE WHEELS THAT IT MADE EASY RIDING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-45 BUT DOROTHY WAS A LITTLE UNEASY AT LOSING THE PATH BECAUSE NOW THERE WAS NOTHING TO GUIDE THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-46 NO HOUSES WERE TO BE SEEN AT ALL SO THEY COULD NOT ASK THEIR WAY OF ANY FARMER,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-47 AND ALTHOUGH THE LAND OF OZ WAS ALWAYS BEAUTIFUL WHEREVER ONE MIGHT GO THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY WAS STRANGE TO ALL THE PARTY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-48 PERHAPS WE'RE LOST SUGGESTED AUNT EM AFTER THEY HAD PROCEEDED QUITE A WAY IN SILENCE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-49 NEVER MIND SAID THE SHAGGY MAN,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-50 I'VE BEEN LOST MANY A TIME AND SO HAS DOROTHY AND WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN FOUND AGAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-51 THAT IS THE WORST OF GETTING LOST IN A PLACE WHERE THERE ARE NO HOUSES NEAR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-52 WE HAD A GOOD DINNER AT THE FUDDLE TOWN SAID UNCLE HENRY AND THAT WILL KEEP US FROM STARVING TO DEATH FOR A LONG TIME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-53 NO ONE EVER STARVED TO DEATH IN OZ DECLARED DOROTHY POSITIVELY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-54 BUT PEOPLE MAY GET PRETTY HUNGRY SOMETIMES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-55 THE WIZARD SAID NOTHING AND HE DID NOT SEEM ESPECIALLY ANXIOUS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-56 THE SAWHORSE WAS TROTTING ALONG BRISKLY YET THE FOREST SEEMED FARTHER AWAY THAN THEY HAD THOUGHT WHEN THEY FIRST SAW IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-57 SO IT WAS NEARLY SUNDOWN WHEN THEY FINALLY CAME TO THE TREES,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-58 BUT NOW THEY FOUND THEMSELVES IN A MOST BEAUTIFUL SPOT THE WIDE SPREADING TREES BEING COVERED WITH FLOWERING VINES AND HAVING SOFT MOSSES UNDERNEATH THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-59 THIS WILL BE A GOOD PLACE TO CAMP SAID THE WIZARD AS THE SAWHORSE STOPPED FOR FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-60 CAMP!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-61 THEY ALL ECHOED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-62 CERTAINLY ASSERTED THE WIZARD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-63 IT WILL BE DARK BEFORE VERY LONG AND WE CANNOT TRAVEL THROUGH THIS FOREST AT NIGHT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-64 SO LET US MAKE A CAMP HERE AND HAVE SOME SUPPER AND SLEEP UNTIL DAYLIGHT COMES AGAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-65 THEY ALL LOOKED AT THE LITTLE MAN IN ASTONISHMENT AND AUNT EM SAID WITH A SNIFF, A PRETTY CAMP WE'LL HAVE I MUST SAY!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-66 I SUPPOSE YOU INTEND US TO SLEEP UNDER THE WAGON.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-67 AND CHEW GRASS FOR OUR SUPPER ADDED THE SHAGGY MAN LAUGHING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-68 BUT DOROTHY SEEMED TO HAVE NO DOUBTS AND WAS QUITE CHEERFUL IT'S LUCKY WE HAVE THE WONDERFUL WIZARD WITH US SHE SAID,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-69 BECAUSE HE CAN DO MOST ANYTHING HE WANTS TO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-70 OH YES,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-71 I FORGOT WE HAD A WIZARD SAID UNCLE HENRY LOOKING AT THE LITTLE MAN CURIOUSLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-72 THE WIZARD SMILED AND CLIMBED OUT OF THE WAGON AND ALL THE OTHERS FOLLOWED HIM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-73 IN ORDER TO CAMP SAID HE THE FIRST THING WE NEED IS TENTS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-74 WILL SOME ONE PLEASE LEND ME A HANDKERCHIEF?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-75 THE SHAGGY MAN OFFERED HIM ONE AND AUNT EM ANOTHER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-76 HE TOOK THEM BOTH AND LAID THEM CAREFULLY UPON THE GRASS NEAR TO THE EDGE OF THE FOREST.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-77 THEN HE LAID HIS OWN HANDKERCHIEF DOWN TOO AND STANDING A LITTLE BACK FROM THEM HE WAVED HIS LEFT HAND TOWARD THE HANDKERCHIEFS AND SAID, TENTS OF CANVAS WHITE AS SNOW LET ME SEE HOW FAST YOU GROW!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-78 THEN LO AND BEHOLD!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-79 THE HANDKERCHIEFS BECAME TINY TENTS AND AS THE TRAVELERS LOOKED AT THEM THE TENTS GREW BIGGER AND BIGGER UNTIL IN A FEW MINUTES EACH ONE WAS LARGE ENOUGH TO CONTAIN THE ENTIRE PARTY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-80 THIS SAID THE WIZARD POINTING TO THE FIRST TENT IS FOR THE ACCOMMODATION OF THE LADIES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-81 DOROTHY YOU AND YOUR AUNT MAY STEP INSIDE AND TAKE OFF YOUR THINGS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-82 EVERY ONE RAN TO LOOK INSIDE THE TENT AND THEY SAW TWO PRETTY WHITE BEDS ALL READY FOR DOROTHY AND AUNT EM AND A SILVER ROOST FOR BILLINA.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-83 RUGS WERE SPREAD UPON THE GRASSY FLOOR AND SOME CAMP CHAIRS AND A TABLE COMPLETED THE FURNITURE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-84 WELL WELL WELL!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-85 THIS BEATS ANYTHING I EVER SAW OR HEARD OF!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-86 EXCLAIMED AUNT EM AND SHE GLANCED AT THE WIZARD ALMOST FEARFULLY AS IF HE MIGHT BE DANGEROUS BECAUSE OF HIS GREAT POWERS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-87 OH MISTER WIZARD!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-88 HOW DID YOU MANAGE TO DO IT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-89 ASKED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-90 IT'S A TRICK GLINDA THE SORCERESS TAUGHT ME AND IT IS MUCH BETTER MAGIC THAN I USED TO PRACTICE IN OMAHA OR WHEN I FIRST CAME TO OZ HE ANSWERED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-91 WHEN THE GOOD GLINDA FOUND I WAS TO LIVE IN THE EMERALD CITY ALWAYS SHE PROMISED TO HELP ME BECAUSE SHE SAID THE WIZARD OF OZ OUGHT REALLY TO BE A CLEVER WIZARD AND NOT A HUMBUG.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-92 SO WE HAVE BEEN MUCH TOGETHER AND I AM LEARNING SO FAST THAT I EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH SOME REALLY WONDERFUL THINGS IN TIME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-93 YOU'VE DONE IT NOW!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-94 DECLARED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-95 THESE TENTS ARE JUST WONDERFUL!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-96 BUT COME AND SEE THE MEN'S TENT SAID THE WIZARD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-97 SO THEY WENT TO THE SECOND TENT WHICH HAD SHAGGY EDGES BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN MADE FROM THE SHAGGY MAN'S HANDKERCHIEF AND FOUND THAT COMPLETELY FURNISHED ALSO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-98 IT CONTAINED FOUR NEAT BEDS FOR UNCLE HENRY OMBY AMBY THE SHAGGY MAN AND THE WIZARD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-99 ALSO THERE WAS A SOFT RUG FOR TOTO TO LIE UPON.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-100 THE THIRD TENT EXPLAINED THE WIZARD IS OUR DINING ROOM AND KITCHEN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-101 THEY VISITED THAT NEXT AND FOUND A TABLE AND DISHES IN THE DINING TENT WITH PLENTY OF THOSE THINGS NECESSARY TO USE IN COOKING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-102 THE WIZARD CARRIED OUT A BIG KETTLE AND SET IT SWINGING ON A CROSSBAR BEFORE THE TENT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-103 WHILE HE WAS DOING THIS OMBY AMBY AND THE SHAGGY MAN BROUGHT A SUPPLY OF TWIGS FROM THE FOREST AND THEN THEY BUILT A FIRE UNDERNEATH THE KETTLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-104 NOW DOROTHY SAID THE WIZARD SMILING I EXPECT YOU TO COOK OUR SUPPER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-105 BUT THERE IS NOTHING IN THE KETTLE SHE CRIED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-106 ARE YOU SURE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-107 INQUIRED THE WIZARD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-108 I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING PUT IN AND I'M ALMOST SURE IT WAS EMPTY WHEN YOU BROUGHT IT OUT SHE REPLIED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-109 NEVERTHELESS SAID THE LITTLE MAN WINKING SLYLY AT UNCLE HENRY YOU WILL DO WELL TO WATCH OUR SUPPER MY DEAR AND SEE THAT IT DOESN'T BOIL OVER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-110 THEN THE MEN TOOK SOME PAILS AND WENT INTO THE FOREST TO SEARCH FOR A SPRING OF WATER AND WHILE THEY WERE GONE AUNT EM SAID TO DOROTHY, I BELIEVE THE WIZARD IS FOOLING US.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-111 I SAW THE KETTLE MYSELF AND WHEN HE HUNG IT OVER THE FIRE THERE WASN'T A THING IN IT BUT AIR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-112 DON'T WORRY REMARKED BILLINA CONFIDENTLY AS SHE NESTLED IN THE GRASS BEFORE THE FIRE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-113 YOU'LL FIND SOMETHING IN THE KETTLE WHEN IT'S TAKEN OFF AND IT WON'T BE POOR INNOCENT CHICKENS EITHER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-114 YOUR HEN HAS VERY BAD MANNERS DOROTHY SAID AUNT EM LOOKING SOMEWHAT DISDAINFULLY AT BILLINA.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-115 IT SEEMS TOO BAD SHE EVER LEARNED HOW TO TALK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-116 THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ANOTHER UNPLEASANT QUARREL BETWEEN AUNT EM AND BILLINA HAD NOT THE MEN RETURNED JUST THEN WITH THEIR PAILS FILLED WITH CLEAR SPARKLING WATER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-117 THE WIZARD TOLD DOROTHY THAT SHE WAS A GOOD COOK AND HE BELIEVED THEIR SUPPER WAS READY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-118 SO UNCLE HENRY LIFTED THE KETTLE FROM THE FIRE AND POURED ITS CONTENTS INTO A BIG PLATTER WHICH THE WIZARD HELD FOR HIM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-119 THE PLATTER WAS FAIRLY HEAPED WITH A FINE STEW SMOKING HOT WITH MANY KINDS OF VEGETABLES AND DUMPLINGS AND A RICH DELICIOUS GRAVY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-120 THE WIZARD TRIUMPHANTLY PLACED THE PLATTER UPON THE TABLE IN THE DINING TENT AND THEN THEY ALL SAT DOWN IN CAMP CHAIRS TO THE FEAST.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-121 THERE WERE SEVERAL OTHER DISHES ON THE TABLE ALL CAREFULLY COVERED AND WHEN THE TIME CAME TO REMOVE THESE COVERS THEY FOUND BREAD AND BUTTER CAKES CHEESE PICKLES AND FRUITS INCLUDING SOME OF THE LUSCIOUS STRAWBERRIES OF OZ. NO ONE VENTURED TO ASK A QUESTION AS TO HOW THESE THINGS CAME THERE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-122 THEY CONTENTED THEMSELVES BY EATING HEARTILY THE GOOD THINGS PROVIDED AND TOTO AND BILLINA HAD THEIR FULL SHARE YOU MAY BE SURE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-123 AFTER THE MEAL WAS OVER AUNT EM WHISPERED TO DOROTHY, THAT MAY HAVE BEEN MAGIC FOOD MY DEAR AND FOR THAT REASON PERHAPS IT WON'T BE VERY NOURISHING,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-124 BUT I'M WILLING TO SAY IT TASTED AS GOOD AS ANYTHING I EVER ET.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-125 THEN SHE ADDED IN A LOUDER VOICE, WHO'S GOING TO DO THE DISHES?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-126 NO ONE MADAM ANSWERED THE WIZARD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-127 THE DISHES HAVE DONE THEMSELVES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-128 LA SAKES!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-129 EJACULATED THE GOOD LADY HOLDING UP HER HANDS IN AMAZEMENT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-14-130 FOR SURE ENOUGH WHEN SHE LOOKED AT THE DISHES THEY HAD A MOMENT BEFORE LEFT UPON THE TABLE SHE FOUND THEM ALL WASHED AND DRIED AND PILED UP INTO NEAT STACKS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-01 CHAPTER FIFTEEN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-02 HOW DOROTHY HAPPENED TO GET LOST IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL EVENING SO THEY DREW THEIR CAMP CHAIRS IN A CIRCLE BEFORE ONE OF THE TENTS AND BEGAN TO TELL STORIES TO AMUSE THEMSELVES AND PASS AWAY THE TIME BEFORE THEY WENT TO BED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-03 PRETTY SOON A ZEBRA WAS SEEN COMING OUT OF THE FOREST AND HE TROTTED STRAIGHT UP TO THEM AND SAID POLITELY, GOOD EVENING PEOPLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-04 THE ZEBRA WAS A SLEEK LITTLE ANIMAL AND HAD A SLENDER HEAD A STUBBY MANE AND A PAINT BRUSH TAIL VERY LIKE A DONKEY'S.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-05 HIS NEATLY SHAPED WHITE BODY WAS COVERED WITH REGULAR BARS OF DARK BROWN AND HIS HOOFS WERE DELICATE AS THOSE OF A DEER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-06 GOOD EVENING FRIEND ZEBRA SAID OMBY AMBY IN REPLY TO THE CREATURE'S GREETING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-07 CAN WE DO ANYTHING FOR YOU?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-08 YES ANSWERED THE ZEBRA.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-09 I SHOULD LIKE YOU TO SETTLE A DISPUTE THAT HAS LONG BEEN A BOTHER TO ME AS TO WHETHER THERE IS MORE WATER OR LAND IN THE WORLD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-10 WHO ARE YOU DISPUTING WITH?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-11 ASKED THE WIZARD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-12 WITH A SOFT SHELL CRAB SAID THE ZEBRA.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-13 HE LIVES IN A POOL WHERE I GO TO DRINK EVERY DAY AND HE IS A VERY IMPERTINENT CRAB I ASSURE YOU.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-14 I HAVE TOLD HIM MANY TIMES THAT THE LAND IS MUCH GREATER IN EXTENT THAN THE WATER BUT HE WILL NOT BE CONVINCED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-15 EVEN THIS VERY EVENING WHEN I TOLD HIM HE WAS AN INSIGNIFICANT CREATURE WHO LIVED IN A SMALL POOL HE ASSERTED THAT THE WATER WAS GREATER AND MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE LAND.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-16 SO SEEING YOUR CAMP I DECIDED TO ASK YOU TO SETTLE THE DISPUTE FOR ONCE AND ALL THAT I MAY NOT BE FURTHER ANNOYED BY THIS IGNORANT CRAB.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-17 WHEN THEY HAD LISTENED TO THIS EXPLANATION DOROTHY INQUIRED, WHERE IS THE SOFT SHELL CRAB?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-18 NOT FAR AWAY REPLIED THE ZEBRA.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-19 IF YOU WILL AGREE TO JUDGE BETWEEN US I WILL RUN AND GET HIM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-20 RUN ALONG THEN SAID THE LITTLE GIRL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-21 SO THE ANIMAL PRANCED INTO THE FOREST AND SOON CAME TROTTING BACK TO THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-22 WHEN HE DREW NEAR THEY FOUND A SOFT SHELL CRAB CLINGING FAST TO THE STIFF HAIR OF THE ZEBRA'S HEAD WHERE IT HELD ON BY ONE CLAW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-23 NOW THEN MISTER CRAB SAID THE ZEBRA HERE ARE THE PEOPLE I TOLD YOU ABOUT,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-24 AND THEY KNOW MORE THAN YOU DO WHO LIVES IN A POOL AND MORE THAN I DO WHO LIVES IN A FOREST.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-25 FOR THEY HAVE BEEN TRAVELERS ALL OVER THE WORLD AND KNOW EVERY PART OF IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-26 THERE IS MORE OF THE WORLD THAN OZ DECLARED THE CRAB IN A STUBBORN VOICE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-27 THAT IS TRUE SAID DOROTHY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-28 BUT I USED TO LIVE IN KANSAS IN THE UNITED STATES AND I'VE BEEN TO CALIFORNIA AND TO AUSTRALIA AND SO HAS UNCLE HENRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-29 FOR MY PART ADDED THE SHAGGY MAN I'VE BEEN TO MEXICO AND BOSTON AND MANY OTHER FOREIGN COUNTRIES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-30 AND I SAID THE WIZARD HAVE BEEN TO EUROPE AND IRELAND.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-31 SO YOU SEE CONTINUED THE ZEBRA ADDRESSING THE CRAB HERE ARE PEOPLE OF REAL CONSEQUENCE WHO KNOW WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-32 THEN THEY KNOW THERE'S MORE WATER IN THE WORLD THAN THERE IS LAND ASSERTED THE CRAB IN A SHRILL PETULANT VOICE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-33 THEY KNOW YOU ARE WRONG TO MAKE SUCH AN ABSURD STATEMENT AND THEY WILL PROBABLY THINK YOU ARE A LOBSTER INSTEAD OF A CRAB RETORTED THE ANIMAL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-34 AT THIS TAUNT THE CRAB REACHED OUT ITS OTHER CLAW AND SEIZED THE ZEBRA'S EAR AND THE CREATURE GAVE A CRY OF PAIN AND BEGAN PRANCING UP AND DOWN TRYING TO SHAKE OFF THE CRAB WHICH CLUNG FAST.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-35 STOP PINCHING!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-36 CRIED THE ZEBRA.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-37 YOU PROMISED NOT TO PINCH IF I WOULD CARRY YOU HERE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-38 AND YOU PROMISED TO TREAT ME RESPECTFULLY SAID THE CRAB LETTING GO THE EAR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-39 WELL HAVEN'T I?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-40 DEMANDED THE ZEBRA.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-41 NO,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-42 YOU CALLED ME A LOBSTER SAID THE CRAB.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-43 LADIES AND GENTLEMEN CONTINUED THE ZEBRA PLEASE PARDON MY POOR FRIEND BECAUSE HE IS IGNORANT AND STUPID AND DOES NOT UNDERSTAND.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-44 ALSO THE PINCH OF HIS CLAW IS VERY ANNOYING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-45 SO PRAY TELL HIM THAT THE WORLD CONTAINS MORE LAND THAN WATER AND WHEN HE HAS HEARD YOUR JUDGMENT I WILL CARRY HIM BACK AND DUMP HIM INTO HIS POOL WHERE I HOPE HE WILL BE MORE MODEST IN THE FUTURE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-46 BUT WE CANNOT TELL HIM THAT SAID DOROTHY GRAVELY BECAUSE IT WOULD NOT BE TRUE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-47 WHAT!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-48 EXCLAIMED THE ZEBRA IN ASTONISHMENT,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-49 DO I HEAR YOU ARIGHT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-50 THE SOFT SHELL CRAB IS CORRECT DECLARED THE WIZARD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-51 THERE IS CONSIDERABLY MORE WATER THAN THERE IS LAND IN THE WORLD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-52 IMPOSSIBLE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-53 PROTESTED THE ZEBRA.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-54 WHY I CAN RUN FOR DAYS UPON THE LAND AND FIND BUT LITTLE WATER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-55 DID YOU EVER SEE AN OCEAN?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-56 ASKED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-57 NEVER ADMITTED THE ZEBRA.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-58 THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS AN OCEAN IN THE LAND OF OZ. WELL THERE ARE SEVERAL OCEANS IN THE WORLD SAID DOROTHY AND PEOPLE SAIL IN SHIPS UPON THESE OCEANS FOR WEEKS AND WEEKS AND NEVER SEE A BIT OF LAND AT ALL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-59 AND THE JOGGERFYS WILL TELL YOU THAT ALL THE OCEANS PUT TOGETHER ARE BIGGER THAN ALL THE LAND PUT TOGETHER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-60 AT THIS THE CRAB BEGAN LAUGHING IN QUEER CHUCKLES THAT REMINDED DOROTHY OF THE WAY BILLINA SOMETIMES CACKLED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-61 NOW WILL YOU GIVE UP MISTER ZEBRA?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-62 IT CRIED JEERINGLY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-63 NOW WILL YOU GIVE UP?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-64 THE ZEBRA SEEMED MUCH HUMBLED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-65 OF COURSE I CANNOT READ GEOGRAPHYS HE SAID.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-66 YOU COULD TAKE ONE OF THE WIZARD'S SCHOOL PILLS SUGGESTED BILLINA AND THAT WOULD MAKE YOU LEARNED AND WISE WITHOUT STUDYING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-67 THE CRAB BEGAN LAUGHING AGAIN WHICH SO PROVOKED THE ZEBRA THAT HE TRIED TO SHAKE THE LITTLE CREATURE OFF.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-68 THIS RESULTED IN MORE EAR PINCHING AND FINALLY DOROTHY TOLD THEM THAT IF THEY COULD NOT BEHAVE THEY MUST GO BACK TO THE FOREST.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-69 I'M SORRY I ASKED YOU TO DECIDE THIS QUESTION SAID THE ZEBRA CROSSLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-70 SO LONG AS NEITHER OF US COULD PROVE WE WERE RIGHT WE QUITE ENJOYED THE DISPUTE,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-71 BUT NOW I CAN NEVER DRINK AT THAT POOL AGAIN WITHOUT THE SOFT SHELL CRAB LAUGHING AT ME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-72 SO I MUST FIND ANOTHER DRINKING PLACE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-73 DO!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-74 DO YOU IGNORAMUS!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-75 SHOUTED THE CRAB AS LOUDLY AS HIS LITTLE VOICE WOULD CARRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-76 RILE SOME OTHER POOL WITH YOUR CLUMSY HOOFS AND LET YOUR BETTERS ALONE AFTER THIS!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-77 THEN THE ZEBRA TROTTED BACK TO THE FOREST BEARING THE CRAB WITH HIM AND DISAPPEARED AMID THE GLOOM OF THE TREES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-78 AND AS IT WAS NOW GETTING DARK THE TRAVELERS SAID GOOD NIGHT TO ONE ANOTHER AND WENT TO BED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-79 DOROTHY AWOKE JUST AS THE LIGHT WAS BEGINNING TO GET STRONG NEXT MORNING AND NOT CARING TO SLEEP ANY LATER SHE QUIETLY GOT OUT OF BED DRESSED HERSELF AND LEFT THE TENT WHERE AUNT EM WAS YET PEACEFULLY SLUMBERING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-80 OUTSIDE SHE NOTICED BILLINA BUSILY PECKING AROUND TO SECURE BUGS OR OTHER FOOD FOR BREAKFAST BUT NONE OF THE MEN IN THE OTHER TENT SEEMED AWAKE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-81 SO THE LITTLE GIRL DECIDED TO TAKE A WALK IN THE WOODS AND TRY TO DISCOVER SOME PATH OR ROAD THAT THEY MIGHT FOLLOW WHEN THEY AGAIN STARTED UPON THEIR JOURNEY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-82 SHE HAD REACHED THE EDGE OF THE FOREST WHEN THE YELLOW HEN CAME FLUTTERING ALONG AND ASKED WHERE SHE WAS GOING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-83 JUST TO TAKE A WALK BILLINA,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-84 AND MAYBE I'LL FIND SOME PATH SAID DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-85 THEN I'LL GO ALONG DECIDED BILLINA AND SCARCELY HAD SHE SPOKEN WHEN TOTO RAN UP AND JOINED THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-86 TOTO AND THE YELLOW HEN HAD BECOME QUITE FRIENDLY BY THIS TIME ALTHOUGH AT FIRST THEY DID NOT GET ALONG WELL TOGETHER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-87 BILLINA HAD BEEN RATHER SUSPICIOUS OF DOGS AND TOTO HAD HAD AN IDEA THAT IT WAS EVERY DOG'S DUTY TO CHASE A HEN ON SIGHT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-88 BUT DOROTHY HAD TALKED TO THEM AND SCOLDED THEM FOR NOT BEING AGREEABLE TO ONE ANOTHER UNTIL THEY GREW BETTER ACQUAINTED AND BECAME FRIENDS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-89 I WON'T SAY THEY LOVED EACH OTHER DEARLY BUT AT LEAST THEY HAD STOPPED QUARRELING AND NOW MANAGED TO GET ON TOGETHER VERY WELL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-90 THE DAY WAS GROWING LIGHTER EVERY MINUTE AND DRIVING THE BLACK SHADOWS OUT OF THE FOREST,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-91 SO DOROTHY FOUND IT VERY PLEASANT WALKING UNDER THE TREES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-92 SHE WENT SOME DISTANCE IN ONE DIRECTION BUT NOT FINDING A PATH PRESENTLY TURNED IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-93 THERE WAS NO PATH HERE EITHER ALTHOUGH SHE ADVANCED QUITE A WAY INTO THE FOREST WINDING HERE AND THERE AMONG THE TREES AND PEERING THROUGH THE BUSHES IN AN ENDEAVOR TO FIND SOME BEATEN TRACK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-94 I THINK WE'D BETTER GO BACK SUGGESTED THE YELLOW HEN AFTER A TIME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-95 THE PEOPLE WILL ALL BE UP BY THIS TIME AND BREAKFAST WILL BE READY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-96 VERY WELL AGREED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-97 LET'S SEE THE CAMP MUST BE OVER THIS WAY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-98 SHE HAD PROBABLY MADE A MISTAKE ABOUT THAT FOR AFTER THEY HAD GONE FAR ENOUGH TO HAVE REACHED THE CAMP THEY STILL FOUND THEMSELVES IN THE THICK OF THE WOODS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-99 SO THE LITTLE GIRL STOPPED SHORT AND LOOKED AROUND HER AND TOTO GLANCED UP INTO HER FACE WITH HIS BRIGHT LITTLE EYES AND WAGGED HIS TAIL AS IF HE KNEW SOMETHING WAS WRONG.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-100 HE COULDN'T TELL MUCH ABOUT DIRECTION HIMSELF BECAUSE HE HAD SPENT HIS TIME PROWLING AMONG THE BUSHES AND RUNNING HERE AND THERE,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-101 NOR HAD BILLINA PAID MUCH ATTENTION TO WHERE THEY WERE GOING BEING INTERESTED IN PICKING BUGS FROM THE MOSS AS THEY PASSED ALONG.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-102 THE YELLOW HEN NOW TURNED ONE EYE UP TOWARD THE LITTLE GIRL AND ASKED, HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN WHERE THE CAMP IS DOROTHY?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-103 YES SHE ADMITTED,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-104 HAVE YOU BILLINA?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-105 I DIDN'T TRY TO REMEMBER RETURNED BILLINA.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-106 I'D NO IDEA YOU WOULD GET LOST DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-107 IT'S THE THING WE DON'T EXPECT BILLINA THAT USUALLY HAPPENS OBSERVED THE GIRL THOUGHTFULLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-108 BUT IT'S NO USE STANDING HERE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-109 LET'S GO IN THAT DIRECTION POINTING A FINGER AT RANDOM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-110 IT MAY BE WE'LL GET OUT OF THE FOREST OVER THERE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-111 SO ON THEY WENT AGAIN BUT THIS WAY THE TREES WERE CLOSER TOGETHER AND THE VINES WERE SO TANGLED THAT OFTEN THEY TRIPPED DOROTHY UP.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-112 SUDDENLY A VOICE CRIED SHARPLY, HALT!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-113 AT FIRST DOROTHY COULD SEE NOTHING ALTHOUGH SHE LOOKED AROUND VERY CAREFULLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-114 BUT BILLINA EXCLAIMED, WELL I DECLARE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-115 WHAT IS IT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-116 ASKED THE LITTLE GIRL, FOR TOTO BEGAN BARKING AT SOMETHING AND FOLLOWING HIS GAZE SHE DISCOVERED WHAT IT WAS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-117 A ROW OF SPOONS HAD SURROUNDED THE THREE AND THESE SPOONS STOOD STRAIGHT UP ON THEIR HANDLES AND CARRIED SWORDS AND MUSKETS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-118 THEIR FACES WERE OUTLINED IN THE POLISHED BOWLS AND THEY LOOKED VERY STERN AND SEVERE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-119 DOROTHY LAUGHED AT THE QUEER THINGS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-120 WHO ARE YOU?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-121 SHE ASKED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-122 WE'RE THE SPOON BRIGADE SAID ONE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-123 IN THE SERVICE OF HIS MAJESTY KING KLEAVER SAID ANOTHER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-124 AND YOU ARE OUR PRISONERS SAID A THIRD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-125 DOROTHY SAT DOWN ON AN OLD STUMP AND LOOKED AT THEM HER EYES TWINKLING WITH AMUSEMENT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-126 WHAT WOULD HAPPEN SHE INQUIRED IF I SHOULD SET MY DOG ON YOUR BRIGADE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-127 HE WOULD DIE REPLIED ONE OF THE SPOONS SHARPLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-128 ONE SHOT FROM OUR DEADLY MUSKETS WOULD KILL HIM BIG AS HE IS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-129 DON'T RISK IT DOROTHY ADVISED THE YELLOW HEN. REMEMBER THIS IS A FAIRY COUNTRY YET NONE OF US THREE HAPPENS TO BE A FAIRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-130 DOROTHY GREW SOBER AT THIS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-131 P'RAPS YOU'RE RIGHT BILLINA SHE ANSWERED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-132 BUT HOW FUNNY IT IS TO BE CAPTURED BY A LOT OF SPOONS!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-133 I DO NOT SEE ANYTHING VERY FUNNY ABOUT IT DECLARED A SPOON.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-134 WE'RE THE REGULAR MILITARY BRIGADE OF THE KINGDOM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-135 WHAT KINGDOM?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-136 SHE ASKED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-137 UTENSIA SAID HE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-138 I NEVER HEARD OF IT BEFORE ASSERTED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-139 THEN SHE ADDED THOUGHTFULLY I DON'T BELIEVE OZMA EVER HEARD OF UTENSIA EITHER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-140 TELL ME ARE YOU NOT SUBJECTS OF OZMA OF OZ?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-141 WE HAVE NEVER HEARD OF HER RETORTED A SPOON.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-142 WE ARE SUBJECTS OF KING KLEAVER AND OBEY ONLY HIS ORDERS WHICH ARE TO BRING ALL PRISONERS TO HIM AS SOON AS THEY ARE CAPTURED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-143 SO STEP LIVELY MY GIRL AND MARCH WITH US OR WE MAY BE TEMPTED TO CUT OFF A FEW OF YOUR TOES WITH OUR SWORDS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-144 THIS THREAT MADE DOROTHY LAUGH AGAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-145 SHE DID NOT BELIEVE SHE WAS IN ANY DANGER,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-15-146 BUT HERE WAS A NEW AND INTERESTING ADVENTURE SO SHE WAS WILLING TO BE TAKEN TO UTENSIA THAT SHE MIGHT SEE WHAT KING KLEAVER'S KINGDOM WAS LIKE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-01 CHAPTER SIXTEEN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-02 HOW DOROTHY VISITED UTENSIA THERE MUST HAVE BEEN FROM SIX TO EIGHT DOZEN SPOONS IN THE BRIGADE AND THEY MARCHED AWAY IN THE SHAPE OF A HOLLOW SQUARE WITH DOROTHY BILLINA AND TOTO IN THE CENTER OF THE SQUARE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-03 BEFORE THEY HAD GONE VERY FAR TOTO KNOCKED OVER ONE OF THE SPOONS BY WAGGING HIS TAIL AND THEN THE CAPTAIN OF THE SPOONS TOLD THE LITTLE DOG TO BE MORE CAREFUL OR HE WOULD BE PUNISHED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-04 SO TOTO WAS CAREFUL AND THE SPOON BRIGADE MOVED ALONG WITH ASTONISHING SWIFTNESS WHILE DOROTHY REALLY HAD TO WALK FAST TO KEEP UP WITH IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-05 BY AND BY THEY LEFT THE WOODS AND ENTERED A BIG CLEARING IN WHICH WAS THE KINGDOM OF UTENSIA.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-06 STANDING ALL AROUND THE CLEARING WERE A GOOD MANY COOKSTOVES RANGES AND GRILLS OF ALL SIZES AND SHAPES AND BESIDES THESE THERE WERE SEVERAL KITCHEN CABINETS AND CUPBOARDS AND A FEW KITCHEN TABLES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-07 THESE THINGS WERE CROWDED WITH UTENSILS OF ALL SORTS, FRYING PANS SAUCE PANS KETTLES FORKS KNIVES BASTING AND SOUP SPOONS NUTMEG GRATERS SIFTERS COLANDERS MEAT SAWS FLAT IRONS ROLLING PINS AND MANY OTHER THINGS OF A LIKE NATURE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-08 WHEN THE SPOON BRIGADE APPEARED WITH THE PRISONERS A WILD SHOUT AROSE AND MANY OF THE UTENSILS HOPPED OFF THEIR STOVES OR THEIR BENCHES AND RAN CROWDING AROUND DOROTHY AND THE HEN AND THE DOG.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-09 STAND BACK!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-10 CRIED THE CAPTAIN STERNLY AND HE LED HIS CAPTIVES THROUGH THE CURIOUS THRONG UNTIL THEY CAME BEFORE A BIG RANGE THAT STOOD IN THE CENTER OF THE CLEARING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-11 BESIDE THIS RANGE WAS A BUTCHER BLOCK UPON WHICH LAY A GREAT CLEAVER WITH A KEEN EDGE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-12 IT RESTED UPON THE FLAT OF ITS BACK ITS LEGS WERE CROSSED AND IT WAS SMOKING A LONG PIPE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-13 WAKE UP YOUR MAJESTY SAID THE CAPTAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-14 HERE ARE PRISONERS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-15 HEARING THIS KING KLEAVER SAT UP AND LOOKED AT DOROTHY SHARPLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-16 GRISTLE AND FAT!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-17 HE CRIED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-18 WHERE DID THIS GIRL COME FROM?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-19 I FOUND HER IN THE FOREST AND BROUGHT HER HERE A PRISONER REPLIED THE CAPTAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-20 WHY DID YOU DO THAT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-21 INQUIRED THE KING PUFFING HIS PIPE LAZILY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-22 TO CREATE SOME EXCITEMENT THE CAPTAIN ANSWERED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-23 IT IS SO QUIET HERE THAT WE ARE ALL GETTING RUSTY FOR WANT OF AMUSEMENT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-24 FOR MY PART I PREFER TO SEE STIRRING TIMES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-25 NATURALLY RETURNED THE CLEAVER WITH A NOD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-26 I HAVE ALWAYS SAID CAPTAIN WITHOUT A BIT OF IRONY THAT YOU ARE A STERLING OFFICER AND A SOLID CITIZEN BOWLED AND POLISHED TO A DEGREE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-27 BUT WHAT DO YOU EXPECT ME TO DO WITH THESE PRISONERS?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-28 THAT IS FOR YOU TO DECIDE DECLARED THE CAPTAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-29 YOU ARE THE KING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-30 TO BE SURE,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-31 TO BE SURE MUTTERED THE CLEAVER MUSINGLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-32 AS YOU SAY WE HAVE HAD DULL TIMES SINCE THE STEEL AND GRINDSTONE ELOPED AND LEFT US.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-33 COMMAND MY COUNSELORS AND THE ROYAL COURTIERS TO ATTEND ME AS WELL AS THE HIGH PRIEST AND THE JUDGE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-34 WE'LL THEN DECIDE WHAT CAN BE DONE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-35 THE CAPTAIN SALUTED AND RETIRED AND DOROTHY SAT DOWN ON AN OVERTURNED KETTLE AND ASKED, HAVE YOU ANYTHING TO EAT IN YOUR KINGDOM?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-36 HERE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-37 GET UP!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-38 GET OFF FROM ME!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-39 CRIED A FAINT VOICE AT WHICH HIS MAJESTY THE CLEAVER SAID, EXCUSE ME BUT YOU'RE SITTING ON MY FRIEND THE TEN QUART KETTLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-40 DOROTHY AT ONCE AROSE AND THE KETTLE TURNED RIGHT SIDE UP AND LOOKED AT HER REPROACHFULLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-41 I'M A FRIEND OF THE KING SO NO ONE DARES SIT ON ME SAID HE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-42 I'D PREFER A CHAIR ANYWAY SHE REPLIED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-43 SIT ON THAT HEARTH COMMANDED THE KING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-44 SO DOROTHY SAT ON THE HEARTH SHELF OF THE BIG RANGE AND THE SUBJECTS OF UTENSIA BEGAN TO GATHER AROUND IN A LARGE AND INQUISITIVE THRONG.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-45 TOTO LAY AT DOROTHY'S FEET AND BILLINA FLEW UPON THE RANGE WHICH HAD NO FIRE IN IT AND PERCHED THERE AS COMFORTABLY AS SHE COULD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-46 WHEN ALL THE COUNSELORS AND COURTIERS HAD ASSEMBLED AND THESE SEEMED TO INCLUDE MOST OF THE INHABITANTS OF THE KINGDOM THE KING RAPPED ON THE BLOCK FOR ORDER AND SAID, FRIENDS AND FELLOW UTENSILS!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-47 OUR WORTHY COMMANDER OF THE SPOON BRIGADE CAPTAIN DIPP HAS CAPTURED THE THREE PRISONERS YOU SEE BEFORE YOU AND BROUGHT THEM HERE FOR FOR I DON'T KNOW WHAT FOR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-48 SO I ASK YOUR ADVICE HOW TO ACT IN THIS MATTER AND WHAT FATE I SHOULD METE OUT TO THESE CAPTIVES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-49 JUDGE SIFTER STAND ON MY RIGHT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-50 IT IS YOUR BUSINESS TO SIFT THIS AFFAIR TO THE BOTTOM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-51 HIGH PRIEST COLENDER STAND ON MY LEFT AND SEE THAT NO ONE TESTIFIES FALSELY IN THIS MATTER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-52 AS THESE TWO OFFICIALS TOOK THEIR PLACES DOROTHY ASKED, WHY IS THE COLANDER THE HIGH PRIEST?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-53 HE'S THE HOLIEST THING WE HAVE IN THE KINGDOM REPLIED KING KLEAVER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-54 EXCEPT ME SAID A SIEVE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-55 I'M THE WHOLE THING WHEN IT COMES TO HOLES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-56 WHAT WE NEED REMARKED THE KING REBUKINGLY IS A WIRELESS SIEVE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-57 I MUST SPEAK TO MARCONI ABOUT IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-58 THESE OLD FASHIONED SIEVES TALK TOO MUCH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-59 NOW IT IS THE DUTY OF THE KING'S COUNSELORS TO COUNSEL THE KING AT ALL TIMES OF EMERGENCY SO I BEG YOU TO SPEAK OUT AND ADVISE ME WHAT TO DO WITH THESE PRISONERS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-60 I DEMAND THAT THEY BE KILLED SEVERAL TIMES UNTIL THEY ARE DEAD!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-61 SHOUTED A PEPPERBOX HOPPING AROUND VERY EXCITEDLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-62 COMPOSE YOURSELF MISTER PAPRICA ADVISED THE KING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-63 YOUR REMARKS ARE PIQUANT AND HIGHLY SEASONED BUT YOU NEED A SCATTERING OF COMMONSENSE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-64 IT IS ONLY NECESSARY TO KILL A PERSON ONCE TO MAKE HIM DEAD,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-65 BUT I DO NOT SEE THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO KILL THIS LITTLE GIRL AT ALL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-66 I DON'T EITHER SAID DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-67 PARDON ME BUT YOU ARE NOT EXPECTED TO ADVISE ME IN THIS MATTER REPLIED KING KLEAVER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-68 WHY NOT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-69 ASKED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-70 YOU MIGHT BE PREJUDICED IN YOUR OWN FAVOR AND SO MISLEAD US HE SAID.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-71 NOW THEN GOOD SUBJECTS WHO SPEAKS NEXT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-72 I'D LIKE TO SMOOTH THIS THING OVER IN SOME WAY SAID A FLATIRON EARNESTLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-73 WE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE USEFUL TO MANKIND YOU KNOW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-74 BUT THE GIRL ISN'T MANKIND!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-75 SHE'S WOMANKIND!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-76 YELLED A CORKSCREW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-77 WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT IT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-78 INQUIRED THE KING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-79 I'M A LAWYER SAID THE CORKSCREW PROUDLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-80 I AM ACCUSTOMED TO APPEAR AT THE BAR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-81 BUT YOU'RE CROOKED RETORTED THE KING AND THAT DEBARS YOU.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-82 YOU MAY BE A CORKING GOOD LAWYER MISTER POPP BUT I MUST ASK YOU TO WITHDRAW YOUR REMARKS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-83 VERY WELL SAID THE CORKSCREW SADLY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-84 I SEE I HAVEN'T ANY PULL AT THIS COURT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-85 PERMIT ME CONTINUED THE FLATIRON TO PRESS MY SUIT YOUR MAJESTY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-86 I DO NOT WISH TO GLOSS OVER ANY FAULT THE PRISONER MAY HAVE COMMITTED IF SUCH A FAULT EXISTS,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-87 BUT WE OWE HER SOME CONSIDERATION AND THAT'S FLAT!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-88 I'D LIKE TO HEAR FROM PRINCE KARVER SAID THE KING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-89 AT THIS A STATELY CARVINGKNIFE STEPPED FORWARD AND BOWED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-90 THE CAPTAIN WAS WRONG TO BRING THIS GIRL HERE AND SHE WAS WRONG TO COME HE SAID.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-91 BUT NOW THAT THE FOOLISH DEED IS DONE LET US ALL PROVE OUR METTLE AND HAVE A SLASHING GOOD TIME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-92 THAT'S IT!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-93 THAT'S IT!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-94 SCREAMED A FAT CHOPPINGKNIFE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-95 WE'LL MAKE MINCEMEAT OF THE GIRL AND HASH OF THE CHICKEN AND SAUSAGE OF THE DOG!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-96 THERE WAS A SHOUT OF APPROVAL AT THIS AND THE KING HAD TO RAP AGAIN FOR ORDER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-97 GENTLEMEN GENTLEMEN!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-98 HE SAID YOUR REMARKS ARE SOMEWHAT CUTTING AND RATHER DISJOINTED AS MIGHT BE EXPECTED FROM SUCH ACUTE INTELLECTS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-99 BUT YOU GIVE ME NO REASONS FOR YOUR DEMANDS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-100 SEE HERE KLEAVER,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-101 YOU MAKE ME TIRED SAID A SAUCEPAN STRUTTING BEFORE THE KING VERY IMPUDENTLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-102 YOU'RE ABOUT THE WORST KING THAT EVER REIGNED IN UTENSIA AND THAT'S SAYING A GOOD DEAL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-103 WHY DON'T YOU RUN THINGS YOURSELF INSTEAD OF ASKING EVERYBODY'S ADVICE LIKE THE BIG CLUMSY IDIOT YOU ARE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-104 THE KING SIGHED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-105 I WISH THERE WASN'T A SAUCEPAN IN MY KINGDOM HE SAID.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-106 YOU FELLOWS ARE ALWAYS STEWING OVER SOMETHING AND EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE YOU SLOP OVER AND MAKE A MESS OF IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-107 GO HANG YOURSELF SIR BY THE HANDLE AND DON'T LET ME HEAR FROM YOU AGAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-108 DOROTHY WAS MUCH SHOCKED BY THE DREADFUL LANGUAGE THE UTENSILS EMPLOYED AND SHE THOUGHT THAT THEY MUST HAVE HAD VERY LITTLE PROPER TRAINING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-109 SO SHE SAID ADDRESSING THE KING WHO SEEMED VERY UNFIT TO RULE HIS TURBULENT SUBJECTS, I WISH YOU'D DECIDE MY FATE RIGHT AWAY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-110 I CAN'T STAY HERE ALL DAY TRYING TO FIND OUT WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO WITH ME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-111 THIS THING IS BECOMING A REGULAR BROIL AND IT'S TIME I TOOK PART IN IT OBSERVED A BIG GRIDIRON COMING FORWARD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-112 WHAT I'D LIKE TO KNOW SAID A CAN OPENER IN A SHRILL VOICE IS WHY THE LITTLE GIRL CAME TO OUR FOREST ANYHOW AND WHY SHE INTRUDED UPON CAPTAIN DIPP WHO OUGHT TO BE CALLED DIPPY AND WHO SHE IS AND WHERE SHE CAME FROM AND WHERE SHE IS GOING AND WHY AND WHEREFORE AND THEREFORE AND WHEN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-113 I'M SORRY TO SEE SIR JABBER REMARKED THE KING TO THE CAN OPENER THAT YOU HAVE SUCH A PRYING DISPOSITION.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-114 AS A MATTER OF FACT ALL THE THINGS YOU MENTION ARE NONE OF OUR BUSINESS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-115 HAVING SAID THIS THE KING RELIGHTED HIS PIPE WHICH HAD GONE OUT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-116 TELL ME PLEASE WHAT IS OUR BUSINESS?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-117 INQUIRED A POTATO MASHER WINKING AT DOROTHY SOMEWHAT IMPERTINENTLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-118 I'M FOND OF LITTLE GIRLS MYSELF AND IT SEEMS TO ME SHE HAS AS MUCH RIGHT TO WANDER IN THE FOREST AS WE HAVE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-119 WHO ACCUSES THE LITTLE GIRL ANYWAY?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-120 INQUIRED A ROLLING PIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-121 WHAT HAS SHE DONE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-122 I DON'T KNOW SAID THE KING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-123 WHAT HAS SHE DONE CAPTAIN DIPP?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-124 THAT'S THE TROUBLE YOUR MAJESTY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-125 SHE HASN'T DONE ANYTHING REPLIED THE CAPTAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-126 WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-127 ASKED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-128 THIS QUESTION SEEMED TO PUZZLE THEM ALL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-129 FINALLY A CHAFINGDISH EXCLAIMED IRRITABLY, IF NO ONE CAN THROW ANY LIGHT ON THIS SUBJECT YOU MUST EXCUSE ME IF I GO OUT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-130 AT THIS A BIG KITCHEN FORK PRICKED UP ITS EARS AND SAID IN A TINY VOICE, LET'S HEAR FROM JUDGE SIFTER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-131 THAT'S PROPER RETURNED THE KING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-132 SO JUDGE SIFTER TURNED AROUND SLOWLY SEVERAL TIMES AND THEN SAID, WE HAVE NOTHING AGAINST THE GIRL EXCEPT THE STOVE HEARTH UPON WHICH SHE SITS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-133 THEREFORE I ORDER HER INSTANTLY DISCHARGED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-134 DISCHARGED!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-135 CRIED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-136 WHY I NEVER WAS DISCHARGED IN MY LIFE AND I DON'T INTEND TO BE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-137 IF IT'S ALL THE SAME TO YOU I'LL RESIGN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-138 IT'S ALL THE SAME DECLARED THE KING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-139 YOU ARE FREE YOU AND YOUR COMPANIONS AND MAY GO WHEREVER YOU LIKE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-140 THANK YOU SAID THE LITTLE GIRL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-141 BUT HAVEN'T YOU ANYTHING TO EAT IN YOUR KINGDOM?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-142 I'M HUNGRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-143 GO INTO THE WOODS AND PICK BLACKBERRIES ADVISED THE KING LYING DOWN UPON HIS BACK AGAIN AND PREPARING TO GO TO SLEEP.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-144 THERE ISN'T A MORSEL TO EAT IN ALL UTENSIA THAT I KNOW OF.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-145 SO DOROTHY JUMPED UP AND SAID, COME ON TOTO AND BILLINA.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-146 IF WE CAN'T FIND THE CAMP WE MAY FIND SOME BLACKBERRIES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-147 THE UTENSILS DREW BACK AND ALLOWED THEM TO PASS WITHOUT PROTEST ALTHOUGH CAPTAIN DIPP MARCHED THE SPOON BRIGADE IN CLOSE ORDER AFTER THEM UNTIL THEY HAD REACHED THE EDGE OF THE CLEARING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-148 THERE THE SPOONS HALTED,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-16-149 BUT DOROTHY AND HER COMPANIONS ENTERED THE FOREST AGAIN AND BEGAN SEARCHING DILIGENTLY FOR A WAY BACK TO THE CAMP THAT THEY MIGHT REJOIN THEIR PARTY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-01 CHAPTER SEVENTEEN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-02 HOW THEY CAME TO BUNBURY WANDERING THROUGH THE WOODS WITHOUT KNOWING WHERE YOU ARE GOING OR WHAT ADVENTURE YOU ARE ABOUT TO MEET NEXT IS NOT AS PLEASANT AS ONE MIGHT THINK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-03 THE WOODS ARE ALWAYS BEAUTIFUL AND IMPRESSIVE AND IF YOU ARE NOT WORRIED OR HUNGRY YOU MAY ENJOY THEM IMMENSELY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-04 BUT DOROTHY WAS WORRIED AND HUNGRY THAT MORNING SO SHE PAID LITTLE ATTENTION TO THE BEAUTIES OF THE FOREST AND HURRIED ALONG AS FAST AS SHE COULD GO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-05 SHE TRIED TO KEEP IN ONE DIRECTION AND NOT CIRCLE AROUND BUT SHE WAS NOT AT ALL SURE THAT THE DIRECTION SHE HAD CHOSEN WOULD LEAD HER TO THE CAMP.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-06 BY AND BY TO HER GREAT JOY SHE CAME UPON A PATH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-07 IT RAN TO THE RIGHT AND TO THE LEFT BEING LOST IN THE TREES IN BOTH DIRECTIONS AND JUST BEFORE HER UPON A BIG OAK WERE FASTENED TWO SIGNS WITH ARMS POINTING BOTH WAYS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-08 ONE SIGN READ, TAKE THE OTHER ROAD TO BUNBURY AND THE SECOND SIGN READ, TAKE THE OTHER ROAD TO BUNNYBURY WELL!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-09 BILLINA EYEING THE SIGNS THIS LOOKS AS IF WE WERE GETTING BACK TO CIVILIZATION AGAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-10 I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THE CIVIL'ZATION DEAR REPLIED THE LITTLE GIRL,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-11 BUT IT LOOKS AS IF WE MIGHT GET SOMEWHERE AND THAT'S A BIG RELIEF ANYHOW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-12 WHICH PATH SHALL WE TAKE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-13 INQUIRED THE YELLOW HEN. DOROTHY STARED AT THE SIGNS THOUGHTFULLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-14 BUNBURY SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING TO EAT SHE SAID.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-15 LET'S GO THERE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-16 IT'S ALL THE SAME TO ME REPLIED BILLINA.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-17 SHE HAD PICKED UP ENOUGH BUGS AND INSECTS FROM THE MOSS AS SHE WENT ALONG TO SATISFY HER OWN HUNGER BUT THE HEN KNEW DOROTHY COULD NOT EAT BUGS,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-18 NOR COULD TOTO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-19 THE PATH TO BUNBURY SEEMED LITTLE TRAVELED BUT IT WAS DISTINCT ENOUGH AND RAN THROUGH THE TREES IN A ZIGZAG COURSE UNTIL IT FINALLY LED THEM TO AN OPEN SPACE FILLED WITH THE QUEEREST HOUSES DOROTHY HAD EVER SEEN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-20 THEY WERE ALL MADE OF CRACKERS LAID OUT IN TINY SQUARES AND WERE OF MANY PRETTY AND ORNAMENTAL SHAPES HAVING BALCONIES AND PORCHES WITH POSTS OF BREAD STICKS AND ROOFS SHINGLED WITH WAFER CRACKERS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-21 THERE WERE WALKS OF BREAD CRUSTS LEADING FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE AND FORMING STREETS AND THE PLACE SEEMED TO HAVE MANY INHABITANTS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-22 WHEN DOROTHY FOLLOWED BY BILLINA AND TOTO ENTERED THE PLACE THEY FOUND PEOPLE WALKING THE STREETS OR ASSEMBLED IN GROUPS TALKING TOGETHER OR SITTING UPON THE PORCHES AND BALCONIES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-23 AND WHAT FUNNY PEOPLE THEY WERE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-24 MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN WERE ALL MADE OF BUNS AND BREAD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-25 SOME WERE THIN AND OTHERS FAT,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-26 SOME WERE WHITE SOME LIGHT BROWN AND SOME VERY DARK OF COMPLEXION.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-27 A FEW OF THE BUNS WHICH SEEMED TO FORM THE MORE IMPORTANT CLASS OF THE PEOPLE WERE NEATLY FROSTED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-28 SOME HAD RAISINS FOR EYES AND CURRANT BUTTONS ON THEIR CLOTHES,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-29 OTHERS HAD EYES OF CLOVES AND LEGS OF STICK CINNAMON AND MANY WORE HATS AND BONNETS FROSTED PINK AND GREEN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-30 THERE WAS SOMETHING OF A COMMOTION IN BUNBURY WHEN THE STRANGERS SUDDENLY APPEARED AMONG THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-31 WOMEN CAUGHT UP THEIR CHILDREN AND HURRIED INTO THEIR HOUSES SHUTTING THE CRACKER DOORS CAREFULLY BEHIND THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-32 SOME MEN RAN SO HASTILY THAT THEY TUMBLED OVER ONE ANOTHER WHILE OTHERS MORE BRAVE ASSEMBLED IN A GROUP AND FACED THE INTRUDERS DEFIANTLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-33 DOROTHY AT ONCE REALIZED THAT SHE MUST ACT WITH CAUTION IN ORDER NOT TO FRIGHTEN THESE SHY PEOPLE WHO WERE EVIDENTLY UNUSED TO THE PRESENCE OF STRANGERS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-34 THERE WAS A DELIGHTFUL FRAGRANT ODOR OF FRESH BREAD IN THE TOWN AND THIS MADE THE LITTLE GIRL MORE HUNGRY THAN EVER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-35 SHE TOLD TOTO AND BILLINA TO STAY BACK WHILE SHE SLOWLY ADVANCED TOWARD THE GROUP THAT STOOD SILENTLY AWAITING HER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-36 YOU MUST SCUSE ME FOR COMING UNEXPECTED SHE SAID SOFTLY BUT I REALLY DIDN'T KNOW I WAS COMING HERE UNTIL I ARRIVED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-37 I WAS LOST IN THE WOODS YOU KNOW AND I'M AS HUNGRY AS ANYTHING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-38 HUNGRY!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-39 THEY MURMURED IN A HORRIFIED CHORUS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-40 YES,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-41 I HAVEN'T HAD ANYTHING TO EAT SINCE LAST NIGHT'S SUPPER SHE EXCLAIMED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-42 ARE THERE ANY EATABLES IN BUNBURY?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-43 THEY LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER UNDECIDEDLY AND THEN ONE PORTLY BUN MAN WHO SEEMED A PERSON OF CONSEQUENCE STEPPED FORWARD AND SAID, LITTLE GIRL TO BE FRANK WITH YOU WE ARE ALL EATABLES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-44 EVERYTHING IN BUNBURY IS EATABLE TO RAVENOUS HUMAN CREATURES LIKE YOU.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-45 BUT IT IS TO ESCAPE BEING EATEN AND DESTROYED THAT WE HAVE SECLUDED OURSELVES IN THIS OUT OF THE WAY PLACE AND THERE IS NEITHER RIGHT NOR JUSTICE IN YOUR COMING HERE TO FEED UPON US.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-46 DOROTHY LOOKED AT HIM LONGINGLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-47 YOU'RE BREAD AREN'T YOU?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-48 ASKED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-49 YES,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-50 BREAD AND BUTTER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-51 THE BUTTER IS INSIDE ME SO IT WON'T MELT AND RUN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-52 I DO THE RUNNING MYSELF.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-53 AT THIS JOKE ALL THE OTHERS BURST INTO A CHORUS OF LAUGHTER AND DOROTHY THOUGHT THEY COULDN'T BE MUCH AFRAID IF THEY COULD LAUGH LIKE THAT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-54 COULDN'T I EAT SOMETHING BESIDES PEOPLE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-55 SHE ASKED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-56 COULDN'T I EAT JUST ONE HOUSE OR A SIDE WALK OR SOMETHING?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-57 I WOULDN'T MIND MUCH WHAT IT WAS YOU KNOW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-58 THIS IS NOT A PUBLIC BAKERY CHILD REPLIED THE MAN STERNLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-59 IT'S PRIVATE PROPERTY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-60 I KNOW MISTER MISTER MY NAME IS C. BUNN ESQUIRE SAID THE MAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-61 C STANDS FOR CINNAMON AND THIS PLACE IS CALLED AFTER MY FAMILY WHICH IS THE MOST ARISTOCRATIC IN THE TOWN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-62 OH I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT OBJECTED ANOTHER OF THE QUEER PEOPLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-63 THE GRAHAMS AND THE BROWNS AND WHITES ARE ALL EXCELLENT FAMILIES AND THERE IS NONE BETTER OF THEIR KIND.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-64 I'M A BOSTON BROWN MYSELF.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-65 I ADMIT YOU ARE ALL DESIRABLE CITIZENS SAID MISTER BUNN RATHER STIFFLY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-66 BUT THE FACT REMAINS THAT OUR TOWN IS CALLED BUNBURY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-67 SCUSE ME INTERRUPTED DOROTHY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-68 BUT I'M GETTING HUNGRIER EVERY MINUTE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-69 NOW IF YOU'RE POLITE AND KIND AS I'M SURE YOU OUGHT TO BE YOU'LL LET ME EAT SOMETHING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-70 THERE'S SO MUCH TO EAT HERE THAT YOU WILL NEVER MISS IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-71 THEN A BIG PUFFED UP MAN OF A DELICATE BROWN COLOR STEPPED FORWARD AND SAID, I THINK IT WOULD BE A SHAME TO SEND THIS CHILD AWAY HUNGRY ESPECIALLY AS SHE AGREES TO EAT WHATEVER WE CAN SPARE AND NOT TOUCH OUR PEOPLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-72 SO DO I POP REPLIED A ROLL WHO STOOD NEAR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-73 WHAT THEN DO YOU SUGGEST MISTER OVER?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-74 INQUIRED MISTER BUNN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-75 WHY I'LL LET HER EAT MY BACK FENCE IF SHE WANTS TO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-76 IT'S MADE OF WAFFLES AND THEY'RE VERY CRISP AND NICE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-77 SHE MAY ALSO EAT MY WHEELBARROW ADDED A PLEASANT LOOKING MUFFIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-78 IT'S MADE OF NABISCOS WITH A ZUZU WHEEL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-79 VERY GOOD,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-80 VERY GOOD REMARKED MISTER BUNN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-81 THAT IS CERTAINLY VERY KIND OF YOU.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-82 GO WITH POP OVER AND MISTER MUFFIN LITTLE GIRL AND THEY WILL FEED YOU.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-83 THANK YOU VERY MUCH SAID DOROTHY GRATEFULLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-84 MAY I BRING MY DOG TOTO AND THE YELLOW HEN?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-85 THEY'RE HUNGRY TOO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-86 WILL YOU MAKE THEM BEHAVE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-87 ASKED THE MUFFIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-88 OF COURSE PROMISED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-89 THEN COME ALONG SAID POP OVER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-90 SO DOROTHY AND BILLINA AND TOTO WALKED UP THE STREET AND THE PEOPLE SEEMED NO LONGER TO BE AT ALL AFRAID OF THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-91 MISTER MUFFIN'S HOUSE CAME FIRST AND AS HIS WHEELBARROW STOOD IN THE FRONT YARD THE LITTLE GIRL ATE THAT FIRST.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-92 IT DIDN'T SEEM VERY FRESH BUT SHE WAS SO HUNGRY THAT SHE WAS NOT PARTICULAR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-93 TOTO ATE SOME TOO WHILE BILLINA PICKED UP THE CRUMBS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-94 WHILE THE STRANGERS WERE ENGAGED IN EATING MANY OF THE PEOPLE CAME AND STOOD IN THE STREET CURIOUSLY WATCHING THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-95 DOROTHY NOTICED SIX ROGUISH LOOKING BROWN CHILDREN STANDING ALL IN A ROW AND SHE ASKED, WHO ARE YOU LITTLE ONES?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-96 WE'RE THE GRAHAM GEMS REPLIED ONE,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-97 AND WE'RE ALL TWINS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-98 BILLINA WHO DECIDED THAT THEY WERE FRESH BAKED,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-99 BUT AT THIS DANGEROUS QUESTION THE SIX LITTLE GEMS RAN AWAY AS FAST AS THEY COULD GO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-100 YOU MUSN'T SAY SUCH THINGS BILLINA SAID DOROTHY REPROVINGLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-101 NOW LET'S GO INTO POP OVER'S BACK YARD AND GET THE WAFFLES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-102 I SORT OF HATE TO LET THAT FENCE GO REMARKED MISTER OVER NERVOUSLY AS THEY WALKED TOWARD HIS HOUSE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-103 THE NEIGHBORS BACK OF US ARE SODA BISCUITS AND I DON'T CARE TO MIX WITH THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-104 BUT I'M HUNGRY YET DECLARED THE GIRL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-105 THAT WHEELBARROW WASN'T VERY BIG.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-106 I'VE GOT A SHORTCAKE PIANO BUT NONE OF MY FAMILY CAN PLAY ON IT HE SAID REFLECTIVELY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-107 SUPPOSE YOU EAT THAT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-108 ALL RIGHT SAID DOROTHY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-109 I DON'T MIND.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-110 ANYTHING TO BE ACCOMMODATING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-111 SO MISTER OVER LED HER INTO THE HOUSE WHERE SHE ATE THE PIANO WHICH WAS OF AN EXCELLENT FLAVOR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-112 IS THERE ANYTHING TO DRINK HERE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-113 SHE ASKED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-114 YES,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-115 I'VE A MILK PUMP AND A WATER PUMP,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-116 WHICH WILL YOU HAVE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-117 HE ASKED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-118 I GUESS I'LL TRY EM BOTH SAID DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-119 SO MISTER OVER CALLED TO HIS WIFE WHO BROUGHT INTO THE YARD A PAIL MADE OF SOME KIND OF BAKED DOUGH AND DOROTHY PUMPED THE PAIL FULL OF COOL SWEET MILK AND DRANK IT EAGERLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-120 THE WIFE OF POP OVER WAS SEVERAL SHADES DARKER THAN HER HUSBAND.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-121 AREN'T YOU OVERDONE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-122 THE LITTLE GIRL ASKED HER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-123 NO INDEED ANSWERED THE WOMAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-124 I'M NEITHER OVERDONE NOR DONE OVER,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-125 I'M JUST MISESS OVER AND I'M THE PRESIDENT OF THE BUNBURY BREAKFAST BAND.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-126 DOROTHY THANKED THEM FOR THEIR HOSPITALITY AND WENT AWAY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-127 AT THE GATE MISTER CINNAMON BUNN MET HER AND SAID HE WOULD SHOW HER AROUND THE TOWN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-128 WE HAVE SOME VERY INTERESTING INHABITANTS HE REMARKED WALKING STIFFLY BESIDE HER ON HIS STICK CINNAMON LEGS,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-129 AND ALL OF US WHO ARE IN GOOD HEALTH ARE WELL BRED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-130 IF YOU ARE NO LONGER HUNGRY WE WILL CALL UPON A FEW OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CITIZENS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-131 TOTO AND BILLINA FOLLOWED BEHIND THEM BEHAVING VERY WELL AND A LITTLE WAY DOWN THE STREET THEY CAME TO A HANDSOME RESIDENCE WHERE AUNT SALLY LUNN LIVED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-132 THE OLD LADY WAS GLAD TO MEET THE LITTLE GIRL AND GAVE HER A SLICE OF WHITE BREAD AND BUTTER WHICH HAD BEEN USED AS A DOOR MAT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-133 IT WAS ALMOST FRESH AND TASTED BETTER THAN ANYTHING DOROTHY HAD EATEN IN THE TOWN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-134 WHERE DO YOU GET THE BUTTER?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-135 SHE INQUIRED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-136 WE DIG IT OUT OF THE GROUND WHICH AS YOU MAY HAVE OBSERVED IS ALL FLOUR AND MEAL REPLIED MISTER BUNN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-137 THERE IS A BUTTER MINE JUST AT THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE VILLAGE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-138 THE TREES WHICH YOU SEE HERE ARE ALL DOUGHLEANDERS AND DOUGHDERAS AND IN THE SEASON WE GET QUITE A CROP OF DOUGH NUTS OFF THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-139 I SHOULD THINK THE FLOUR WOULD BLOW AROUND AND GET INTO YOUR EYES SAID DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-140 NO SAID HE,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-141 WE ARE BOTHERED WITH CRACKER DUST SOMETIMES BUT NEVER WITH FLOUR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-142 THEN HE TOOK HER TO SEE JOHNNY CAKE A CHEERFUL OLD GENTLEMAN WHO LIVED NEAR BY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-143 I SUPPOSE YOU'VE HEARD OF ME SAID OLD JOHNNY WITH AN AIR OF PRIDE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-144 I'M A GREAT FAVORITE ALL OVER THE WORLD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-145 AREN'T YOU RATHER YELLOW?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-146 ASKED DOROTHY LOOKING AT HIM CRITICALLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-147 MAYBE CHILD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-148 BUT DON'T THINK I'M BILIOUS FOR I WAS NEVER IN BETTER HEALTH IN MY LIFE REPLIED THE OLD GENTLEMAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-149 IF ANYTHING AILED ME I'D WILLINGLY ACKNOWLEDGE THE CORN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-150 JOHNNY'S A TRIFLE STALE SAID MISTER BUNN AS THEY WENT AWAY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-151 BUT HE'S A GOOD MIXER AND NEVER GETS CROSS GRAINED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-152 I WILL NOW TAKE YOU TO CALL UPON SOME OF MY OWN RELATIVES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-153 THEY VISITED THE SUGAR BUNNS THE CURRANT BUNNS AND THE SPANISH BUNNS THE LATTER HAVING A DECIDEDLY FOREIGN APPEARANCE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-154 THEN THEY SAW THE FRENCH ROLLS WHO WERE VERY POLITE TO THEM AND MADE A BRIEF CALL UPON THE PARKER H. ROLLS WHO SEEMED A BIT PROUD AND OVERBEARING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-155 BUT THEY'RE NOT AS STUCK UP AS THE FROSTED JUMBLES DECLARED MISTER BUNN WHO ARE PEOPLE I REALLY CAN'T ABIDE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-156 I DON'T LIKE TO BE SUSPICIOUS OR TALK SCANDAL BUT SOMETIMES I THINK THE JUMBLES HAVE TOO MUCH BAKING POWDER IN THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-157 JUST THEN A DREADFUL SCREAM WAS HEARD AND DOROTHY TURNED HASTILY AROUND TO FIND A SCENE OF GREAT EXCITEMENT A LITTLE WAY DOWN THE STREET.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-158 THE PEOPLE WERE CROWDING AROUND TOTO AND THROWING AT HIM EVERYTHING THEY COULD FIND AT HAND.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-159 THEY PELTED THE LITTLE DOG WITH HARD TACK CRACKERS AND EVEN ARTICLES OF FURNITURE WHICH WERE HARD BAKED AND HEAVY ENOUGH FOR MISSILES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-160 TOTO HOWELED A LITTLE AS THE ASSORTMENT OF BAKE STUFF STRUCK HIM,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-161 BUT HE STOOD STILL WITH HEAD BOWED AND TAIL BETWEEN HIS LEGS UNTIL DOROTHY RAN UP AND INQUIRED WHAT THE MATTER WAS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-162 MATTER!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-163 CRIED A RYE LOAFER INDIGNANTLY WHY THE HORRID BEAST HAS EATEN THREE OF OUR DEAR CRUMPETS AND IS NOW DEVOURING A SALT RISING BISCUIT!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-164 OH TOTO!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-165 HOW COULD YOU?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-166 EXCLAIMED DOROTHY MUCH DISTRESSED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-167 TOTO'S MOUTH WAS FULL OF HIS SALT RISING VICTIM,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-168 SO HE ONLY WHINED AND WAGGED HIS TAIL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-169 BUT BILLINA WHO HAD FLOWN TO THE TOP OF A CRACKER HOUSE TO BE IN A SAFE PLACE CALLED OUT, DON'T BLAME HIM DOROTHY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-170 THE CRUMPETS DARED HIM TO DO IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-171 YES AND YOU PECKED OUT THE EYES OF A RAISIN BUNN ONE OF OUR BEST CITIZENS!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-172 SHOUTED A BREAD PUDDING SHAKING ITS FIST AT THE YELLOW HEN. WHAT'S THAT!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-173 WHAT'S THAT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-174 MISTER CINNAMON BUNN WHO HAD NOW JOINED THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-175 OH WHAT A MISFORTUNE WHAT A TERRIBLE MISFORTUNE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-176 SEE HERE SAID DOROTHY DETERMINED TO DEFEND HER PETS I THINK WE'VE TREATED YOU ALL PRETTY WELL SEEING YOU'RE EATABLES AN REG'LAR FOOD FOR US.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-177 I'VE BEEN KIND TO YOU AND EATEN YOUR OLD WHEELBARROWS AND PIANOS AND RUBBISH AN NOT SAID A WORD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-178 BUT TOTO AND BILLINA CAN'T BE SPECTED TO GO HUNGRY WHEN THE TOWN'S FULL OF GOOD THINGS THEY LIKE TO EAT CAUSE THEY CAN'T UNDERSTAND YOUR STINGY WAYS AS I DO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-179 YOU MUST LEAVE HERE AT ONCE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-180 SUPPOSE WE WON'T GO?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-181 DOROTHY WHO WAS NOW MUCH PROVOKED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-182 THEN SAID HE WE WILL PUT YOU INTO THE GREAT OVENS WHERE WE ARE MADE AND BAKE YOU.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-183 DOROTHY GAZED AROUND AND SAW THREATENING LOOKS UPON THE FACES OF ALL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-184 SHE HAD NOT NOTICED ANY OVENS IN THE TOWN BUT THEY MIGHT BE THERE NEVERTHELESS FOR SOME OF THE INHABITANTS SEEMED VERY FRESH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-17-185 SO SHE DECIDED TO GO AND CALLING TO TOTO AND BILLINA TO FOLLOW HER SHE MARCHED UP THE STREET WITH AS MUCH DIGNITY AS POSSIBLE CONSIDERING THAT SHE WAS FOLLOWED BY THE HOOTS AND CRIES OF THE BUNS AND BISCUITS AND OTHER BAKE STUFF.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-18-01 CHAPTER EIGHTEEN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-18-02 HOW OZMA LOOKED INTO THE MAGIC PICTURE PRINCESS OZMA WAS A VERY BUSY LITTLE RULER FOR SHE LOOKED CAREFULLY AFTER THE COMFORT AND WELFARE OF HER PEOPLE AND TRIED TO MAKE THEM HAPPY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-18-03 IF ANY QUARRELS AROSE SHE DECIDED THEM JUSTLY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-18-04 IF ANY ONE NEEDED COUNSEL OR ADVICE SHE WAS READY AND WILLING TO LISTEN TO THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-18-05 FOR A DAY OR TWO AFTER DOROTHY AND HER COMPANIONS HAD STARTED ON THEIR TRIP OZMA WAS OCCUPIED WITH THE AFFAIRS OF HER KINGDOM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-18-06 THEN SHE BEGAN TO THINK OF SOME MANNER OF OCCUPATION FOR UNCLE HENRY AND AUNT EM THAT WOULD BE LIGHT AND EASY AND YET GIVE THE OLD PEOPLE SOMETHING TO DO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-18-07 SHE SOON DECIDED TO MAKE UNCLE HENRY THE KEEPER OF THE JEWELS FOR SOME ONE REALLY WAS NEEDED TO COUNT AND LOOK AFTER THE BINS AND BARRELS OF EMERALDS DIAMONDS RUBIES AND OTHER PRECIOUS STONES THAT WERE IN THE ROYAL STOREHOUSES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-18-08 THAT WOULD KEEP UNCLE HENRY BUSY ENOUGH BUT IT WAS HARDER TO FIND SOMETHING FOR AUNT EM TO DO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-18-09 THE PALACE WAS FULL OF SERVANTS SO THERE WAS NO DETAIL OF HOUSEWORK THAT AUNT EM COULD LOOK AFTER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-18-10 WHILE OZMA SAT IN HER PRETTY ROOM ENGAGED IN THOUGHT SHE HAPPENED TO GLANCE AT HER MAGIC PICTURE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-18-11 THIS WAS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT TREASURES IN ALL THE LAND OF OZ. IT WAS A LARGE PICTURE SET IN A BEAUTIFUL GOLD FRAME AND IT HUNG IN A PROMINENT PLACE UPON A WALL OF OZMA'S PRIVATE ROOM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-18-12 USUALLY THIS PICTURE SEEMED MERELY A COUNTRY SCENE BUT WHENEVER OZMA LOOKED AT IT AND WISHED TO KNOW WHAT ANY OF HER FRIENDS OR ACQUAINTANCES WERE DOING THE MAGIC OF THIS WONDERFUL PICTURE WAS STRAIGHTWAY DISCLOSED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-18-13 FOR THE COUNTRY SCENE WOULD GRADUALLY FADE AWAY AND IN ITS PLACE WOULD APPEAR THE LIKENESS OF THE PERSON OR PERSONS OZMA MIGHT WISH TO SEE SURROUNDED BY THE ACTUAL SCENES IN WHICH THEY WERE THEN PLACED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-18-14 IN THIS WAY THE PRINCESS COULD VIEW ANY PART OF THE WORLD SHE WISHED AND WATCH THE ACTIONS OF ANY ONE IN WHOM SHE WAS INTERESTED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-18-15 OZMA HAD OFTEN SEEN DOROTHY IN HER KANSAS HOME BY THIS MEANS AND NOW HAVING A LITTLE LEISURE SHE EXPRESSED A DESIRE TO SEE HER LITTLE FRIEND AGAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-18-16 IT WAS WHILE THE TRAVELERS WERE AT FUDDLECUMJIG AND OZMA LAUGHED MERRILY AS SHE WATCHED IN THE PICTURE HER FRIENDS TRYING TO MATCH THE PIECES OF GRANDMOTHER GNIT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-18-17 THEY SEEM HAPPY AND ARE DOUBTLESS HAVING A GOOD TIME THE GIRL RULER SAID TO HERSELF,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-18-18 AND THEN SHE BEGAN TO THINK OF THE MANY ADVENTURES SHE HERSELF HAD ENCOUNTERED WITH DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-18-19 THE IMAGE OF HER FRIENDS NOW FADED FROM THE MAGIC PICTURE AND THE OLD LANDSCAPE SLOWLY REAPPEARED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-18-20 OZMA WAS THINKING OF THE TIME WHEN WITH DOROTHY AND HER ARMY SHE MARCHED TO THE NOME KING'S UNDERGROUND CAVERN BEYOND THE LAND OF EV AND FORCED THE OLD MONARCH TO LIBERATE HIS CAPTIVES WHO BELONGED TO THE ROYAL FAMILY OF EV. THAT WAS THE TIME WHEN THE SCARECROW NEARLY FRIGHTENED THE NOME KING INTO FITS BY THROWING ONE OF BILLINA'S EGGS AT HIM AND DOROTHY HAD CAPTURED KING ROQUAT'S MAGIC BELT AND BROUGHT IT AWAY WITH HER TO THE LAND OF OZ. THE PRETTY PRINCESS SMILED AT THE RECOLLECTION OF THIS ADVENTURE AND THEN SHE WONDERED WHAT HAD BECOME OF THE NOME KING SINCE THEN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-18-21 MERELY BECAUSE SHE WAS CURIOUS AND HAD NOTHING BETTER TO DO OZMA GLANCED AT THE MAGIC PICTURE AND WISHED TO SEE IN IT THE KING OF THE NOMES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-18-22 ROQUAT THE RED WENT EVERY DAY INTO HIS TUNNEL TO SEE HOW THE WORK WAS GETTING ALONG AND TO HURRY HIS WORKMEN AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-18-23 HE WAS THERE NOW AND OZMA SAW HIM PLAINLY IN THE MAGIC PICTURE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-18-24 SHE SAW THE UNDERGROUND TUNNEL REACHING FAR UNDERNEATH THE DEADLY DESERT WHICH SEPARATED THE LAND OF OZ FROM THE MOUNTAINS BENEATH WHICH THE NOME KING HAD HIS EXTENSIVE CAVERNS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-18-25 SHE SAW THAT THE TUNNEL WAS BEING MADE IN THE DIRECTION OF THE EMERALD CITY AND KNEW AT ONCE IT WAS BEING DUG SO THAT THE ARMY OF NOMES COULD MARCH THROUGH IT AND ATTACK HER OWN BEAUTIFUL AND PEACEFUL COUNTRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-18-26 I SUPPOSE KING ROQUAT IS PLANNING REVENGE AGAINST US SHE SAID MUSINGLY AND THINKS HE CAN SURPRISE US AND MAKE US HIS CAPTIVES AND SLAVES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-18-27 HOW SAD IT IS THAT ANY ONE CAN HAVE SUCH WICKED THOUGHTS!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-18-28 BUT I MUST NOT BLAME KING ROQUAT TOO SEVERELY FOR HE IS A NOME AND HIS NATURE IS NOT SO GENTLE AS MY OWN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-18-29 THEN SHE DISMISSED FROM HER MIND FURTHER THOUGHT OF THE TUNNEL FOR THAT TIME AND BEGAN TO WONDER IF AUNT EM WOULD NOT BE HAPPY AS ROYAL MENDER OF THE STOCKINGS OF THE RULER OF OZ. OZMA WORE FEW HOLES IN HER STOCKINGS,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-18-30 STILL THEY SOMETIMES NEEDED MENDING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-18-31 AUNT EM OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT VERY NICELY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-18-32 NEXT DAY THE PRINCESS WATCHED THE TUNNEL AGAIN IN HER MAGIC PICTURE AND EVERY DAY AFTERWARD SHE DEVOTED A FEW MINUTES TO INSPECTING THE WORK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-18-33 IT WAS NOT ESPECIALLY INTERESTING BUT SHE FELT THAT IT WAS HER DUTY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-18-34 SLOWLY BUT SURELY THE BIG ARCHED HOLE CREPT THROUGH THE ROCKS UNDERNEATH THE DEADLY DESERT AND DAY BY DAY IT DREW NEARER AND NEARER TO THE EMERALD CITY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-01 CHAPTER NINETEEN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-02 HOW BUNNYBURY WELCOMED THE STRANGERS DOROTHY LEFT BUNBURY THE SAME WAY SHE HAD ENTERED IT AND WHEN THEY WERE IN THE FOREST AGAIN SHE SAID TO BILLINA, I NEVER THOUGHT THAT THINGS GOOD TO EAT COULD BE SO DIS'GREE'BLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-03 OFTEN I'VE EATEN THINGS THAT TASTED GOOD BUT WERE DISAGREEABLE AFTERWARD RETURNED THE YELLOW HEN. I THINK DOROTHY IF EATABLES ARE GOING TO ACT BADLY IT'S BETTER BEFORE THAN AFTER YOU EAT THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-04 P'RAPS YOU'RE RIGHT SAID THE LITTLE GIRL WITH A SIGH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-05 BUT WHAT SHALL WE DO NOW?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-06 LET US FOLLOW THE PATH BACK TO THE SIGNPOST SUGGESTED BILLINA.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-07 THAT WILL BE BETTER THAN GETTING LOST AGAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-08 WHY WE'RE LOST ANYHOW DECLARED DOROTHY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-09 THEY RETURNED ALONG THE PATH TO THE PLACE WHERE THEY HAD FIRST FOUND IT AND AT ONCE TOOK THE OTHER ROAD TO BUNNYBURY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-10 THIS ROAD WAS A MERE NARROW STRIP WORN HARD AND SMOOTH BUT NOT WIDE ENOUGH FOR DOROTHY'S FEET TO TREAD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-11 STILL IT WAS A GUIDE AND THE WALKING THROUGH THE FOREST WAS NOT AT ALL DIFFICULT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-12 BEFORE LONG THEY REACHED A HIGH WALL OF SOLID WHITE MARBLE AND THE PATH CAME TO AN END AT THIS WALL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-13 AT FIRST DOROTHY THOUGHT THERE WAS NO OPENING AT ALL IN THE MARBLE BUT ON LOOKING CLOSELY SHE DISCOVERED A SMALL SQUARE DOOR ABOUT ON A LEVEL WITH HER HEAD AND UNDERNEATH THIS CLOSED DOOR WAS A BELL PUSH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-14 NEAR THE BELL PUSH A SIGN WAS PAINTED IN NEAT LETTERS UPON THE MARBLE AND THE SIGN READ, NO ADMITTANCE EXCEPT ON BUSINESS THIS DID NOT DISCOURAGE DOROTHY HOWEVER AND SHE RANG THE BELL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-15 PRETTY SOON A BOLT WAS CAUTIOUSLY WITHDRAWN AND THE MARBLE DOOR SWUNG SLOWLY OPEN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-16 THEN SHE SAW IT WAS NOT REALLY A DOOR BUT A WINDOW FOR SEVERAL BRASS BARS WERE PLACED ACROSS IT BEING SET FAST IN THE MARBLE AND SO CLOSE TOGETHER THAT THE LITTLE GIRL'S FINGERS MIGHT BARELY GO BETWEEN THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-17 BACK OF THE BARS APPEARED THE FACE OF A WHITE RABBIT A VERY SOBER AND SEDATE FACE WITH AN EYE GLASS HELD IN HIS LEFT EYE AND ATTACHED TO A CORD IN HIS BUTTON HOLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-18 WELL!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-19 WHAT IS IT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-20 THE RABBIT SHARPLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-21 I'M DOROTHY SAID THE GIRL AND I'M LOST AND STATE YOUR BUSINESS PLEASE INTERRUPTED THE RABBIT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-22 MY BUSINESS SHE REPLIED IS TO FIND OUT WHERE I AM AND TO NO ONE IS ALLOWED IN BUNNYBURY WITHOUT AN ORDER OR A LETTER OF INTRODUCTION FROM EITHER OZMA OF OZ OR GLINDA THE GOOD ANNOUNCED THE RABBIT,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-23 SO THAT SETTLES THE MATTER AND HE STARTED TO CLOSE THE WINDOW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-24 WAIT A MINUTE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-25 CRIED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-26 I'VE GOT A LETTER FROM OZMA.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-27 FROM THE RULER OF OZ?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-28 ASKED THE RABBIT DOUBTINGLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-29 OF COURSE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-30 OZMA'S MY BEST FRIEND YOU KNOW,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-31 AND I'M A PRINCESS MYSELF SHE ANNOUNCED EARNESTLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-32 HUM HA!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-33 LET ME SEE YOUR LETTER RETURNED THE RABBIT AS IF HE STILL DOUBTED HER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-34 SO SHE HUNTED IN HER POCKET AND FOUND THE LETTER OZMA HAD GIVEN HER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-35 THEN SHE HANDED IT THROUGH THE BARS TO THE RABBIT WHO TOOK IT IN HIS PAWS AND OPENED IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-36 HE READ IT ALOUD IN A POMPOUS VOICE AS IF TO LET DOROTHY AND BILLINA SEE THAT HE WAS EDUCATED AND COULD READ WRITING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-37 THE LETTER WAS AS FOLLOWS, IT WILL PLEASE ME TO HAVE MY SUBJECTS GREET PRINCESS DOROTHY THE BEARER OF THIS ROYAL MISSIVE WITH THE SAME COURTESY AND CONSIDERATION THEY WOULD EXTEND TO ME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-38 HA HUM!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-39 IT IS SIGNED OZMA OF OZ CONTINUED THE RABBIT AND IS SEALED WITH THE GREAT SEAL OF THE EMERALD CITY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-40 WELL WELL WELL!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-41 HOW STRANGE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-42 HOW REMARKABLE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-43 WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-44 INQUIRED DOROTHY IMPATIENTLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-45 WE MUST OBEY THE ROYAL MANDATE REPLIED THE RABBIT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-46 WE ARE SUBJECTS OF OZMA OF OZ AND WE LIVE IN HER COUNTRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-47 ALSO WE ARE UNDER THE PROTECTION OF THE GREAT SORCERESS GLINDA THE GOOD WHO MADE US PROMISE TO RESPECT OZMA'S COMMANDS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-48 THEN MAY I COME IN?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-49 SHE ASKED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-50 I'LL OPEN THE DOOR SAID THE RABBIT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-51 HE SHUT THE WINDOW AND DISAPPEARED BUT A MOMENT AFTERWARD A BIG DOOR IN THE WALL OPENED AND ADMITTED DOROTHY TO A SMALL ROOM WHICH SEEMED TO BE A PART OF THE WALL AND BUILT INTO IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-52 HERE STOOD THE RABBIT SHE HAD BEEN TALKING WITH AND NOW THAT SHE COULD SEE ALL OF HIM SHE GAZED AT THE CREATURE IN SURPRISE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-53 HE WAS A GOOD SIZED WHITE RABBIT WITH PINK EYES MUCH LIKE ALL OTHER WHITE RABBITS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-54 BUT THE ASTONISHING THING ABOUT HIM WAS THE MANNER IN WHICH HE WAS DRESSED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-55 HE WORE A WHITE SATIN JACKET EMBROIDERED WITH GOLD AND HAVING DIAMOND BUTTONS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-56 HIS VEST WAS ROSE COLORED SATIN WITH TOURMALINE BUTTONS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-57 HIS TROUSERS WERE WHITE TO CORRESPOND WITH THE JACKET AND THEY WERE BAGGY AT THE KNEES LIKE THOSE OF A ZOUAVE BEING TIED WITH KNOTS OF ROSE RIBBONS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-58 HIS SHOES WERE OF WHITE PLUSH WITH DIAMOND BUCKLES AND HIS STOCKINGS WERE ROSE SILK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-59 THE RICHNESS AND EVEN MAGNIFICENCE OF THE RABBIT'S CLOTHING MADE DOROTHY STARE AT THE LITTLE CREATURE WONDERINGLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-60 TOTO AND BILLINA HAD FOLLOWED HER INTO THE ROOM AND WHEN HE SAW THEM THE RABBIT RAN TO A TABLE AND SPRANG UPON IT NIMBLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-61 THEN HE LOOKED AT THE THREE THROUGH HIS MONOCLE AND SAID, THESE COMPANIONS PRINCESS CANNOT ENTER BUNNYBURY WITH YOU.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-62 WHY NOT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-63 ASKED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-64 IN THE FIRST PLACE THEY WOULD FRIGHTEN OUR PEOPLE WHO DISLIKE DOGS ABOVE ALL THINGS ON EARTH,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-65 AND SECONDLY THE LETTER OF THE ROYAL OZMA DOES NOT MENTION THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-66 BUT THEY'RE MY FRIENDS PERSISTED DOROTHY AND GO WHEREVER I GO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-67 NOT THIS TIME SAID THE RABBIT DECIDEDLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-68 YOU YOURSELF PRINCESS ARE A WELCOME VISITOR SINCE YOU COME SO HIGHLY RECOMMENDED,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-69 BUT UNLESS YOU CONSENT TO LEAVE THE DOG AND THE HEN IN THIS ROOM I CANNOT PERMIT YOU TO ENTER THE TOWN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-70 NEVER MIND US DOROTHY SAID BILLINA.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-71 GO INSIDE AND SEE WHAT THE PLACE IS LIKE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-72 YOU CAN TELL US ABOUT IT AFTERWARD AND TOTO AND I WILL REST COMFORTABLY HERE UNTIL YOU RETURN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-73 THIS SEEMED THE BEST THING TO DO FOR DOROTHY WAS CURIOUS TO SEE HOW THE RABBIT PEOPLE LIVED AND SHE WAS AWARE OF THE FACT THAT HER FRIENDS MIGHT FRIGHTEN THE TIMID LITTLE CREATURES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-74 SHE HAD NOT FORGOTTEN HOW TOTO AND BILLINA HAD MISBEHAVED IN BUNBURY AND PERHAPS THE RABBIT WAS WISE TO INSIST ON THEIR STAYING OUTSIDE THE TOWN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-75 VERY WELL SHE SAID I'LL GO IN ALONE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-76 I S'POSE YOU'RE THE KING OF THIS TOWN AREN'T YOU?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-77 NO ANSWERED THE RABBIT I'M MERELY THE KEEPER OF THE WICKET AND A PERSON OF LITTLE IMPORTANCE ALTHOUGH I TRY TO DO MY DUTY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-78 I MUST NOW INFORM YOU PRINCESS THAT BEFORE YOU ENTER OUR TOWN YOU MUST CONSENT TO REDUCE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-79 REDUCE WHAT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-80 ASKED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-81 YOUR SIZE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-82 YOU MUST BECOME THE SIZE OF THE RABBITS ALTHOUGH YOU MAY RETAIN YOUR OWN FORM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-83 WOULDN'T MY CLOTHES BE TOO BIG FOR ME?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-84 SHE INQUIRED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-85 NO,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-86 THEY WILL REDUCE WHEN YOUR BODY DOES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-87 CAN YOU MAKE ME SMALLER?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-88 ASKED THE GIRL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-89 EASILY RETURNED THE RABBIT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-90 AND WILL YOU MAKE ME BIG AGAIN WHEN I'M READY TO GO AWAY?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-91 I WILL SAID HE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-92 ALL RIGHT THEN,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-93 I'M WILLING SHE ANNOUNCED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-94 THE RABBIT JUMPED FROM THE TABLE AND RAN OR RATHER HOPPED TO THE FURTHER WALL WHERE HE OPENED A DOOR SO TINY THAT EVEN TOTO COULD SCARCELY HAVE CRAWLED THROUGH IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-95 FOLLOW ME HE SAID.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-96 NOW ALMOST ANY OTHER LITTLE GIRL WOULD HAVE DECLARED THAT SHE COULD NOT GET THROUGH SO SMALL A DOOR,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-97 BUT DOROTHY HAD ALREADY ENCOUNTERED SO MANY FAIRY ADVENTURES THAT SHE BELIEVED NOTHING WAS IMPOSSIBLE IN THE LAND OF OZ. SO SHE QUIETLY WALKED TOWARD THE DOOR AND AT EVERY STEP SHE GREW SMALLER AND SMALLER UNTIL BY THE TIME THE OPENING WAS REACHED SHE COULD PASS THROUGH IT WITH EASE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-98 INDEED AS SHE STOOD BESIDE THE RABBIT WHO SAT UPON HIS HIND LEGS AND USED HIS PAWS AS HANDS HER HEAD WAS JUST ABOUT AS HIGH AS HIS OWN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-99 THEN THE KEEPER OF THE WICKET PASSED THROUGH AND SHE FOLLOWED AFTER WHICH THE DOOR SWUNG SHUT AND LOCKED ITSELF WITH A SHARP CLICK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-100 DOROTHY NOW FOUND HERSELF IN A CITY SO STRANGE AND BEAUTIFUL THAT SHE GAVE A GASP OF SURPRISE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-101 THE HIGH MARBLE WALL EXTENDED ALL AROUND THE PLACE AND SHUT OUT ALL THE REST OF THE WORLD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-102 AND HERE WERE MARBLE HOUSES OF CURIOUS FORMS MOST OF THEM RESEMBLING OVERTURNED KETTLES BUT WITH DELICATE SLENDER SPIRES AND MINARETS RUNNING FAR UP INTO THE SKY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-103 THE STREETS WERE PAVED WITH WHITE MARBLE AND IN FRONT OF EACH HOUSE WAS A LAWN OF RICH GREEN CLOVER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-104 EVERYTHING WAS AS NEAT AS WAX THE GREEN AND WHITE CONTRASTING PRETTILY TOGETHER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-105 BUT THE RABBIT PEOPLE WERE AFTER ALL THE MOST AMAZING THINGS DOROTHY SAW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-106 THE STREETS WERE FULL OF THEM AND THEIR COSTUMES WERE SO SPLENDID THAT THE RICH DRESS OF THE KEEPER OF THE WICKET WAS COMMONPLACE WHEN COMPARED WITH THE OTHERS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-107 SILKS AND SATINS OF DELICATE HUES SEEMED ALWAYS USED FOR MATERIAL AND NEARLY EVERY COSTUME SPARKLED WITH EXQUISITE GEMS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-108 BUT THE LADY RABBITS OUTSHONE THE GENTLEMEN RABBITS IN SPLENDOR AND THE CUT OF THEIR GOWNS WAS REALLY WONDERFUL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-109 THEY WORE BONNETS TOO WITH FEATHERS AND JEWELS IN THEM AND SOME WHEELED BABY CARRIAGES IN WHICH THE GIRL COULD SEE WEE BUNNIES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-110 SOME WERE LYING ASLEEP WHILE OTHERS LAY SUCKING THEIR PAWS AND LOOKING AROUND THEM WITH BIG PINK EYES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-111 AS DOROTHY WAS NO BIGGER IN SIZE THAN THE GROWN UP RABBITS SHE HAD A CHANCE TO OBSERVE THEM CLOSELY BEFORE THEY NOTICED HER PRESENCE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-112 THEN THEY DID NOT SEEM AT ALL ALARMED ALTHOUGH THE LITTLE GIRL NATURALLY BECAME THE CENTER OF ATTRACTION AND REGARDED HER WITH GREAT CURIOSITY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-113 MAKE WAY!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-114 CRIED THE KEEPER OF THE WICKET IN A POMPOUS VOICE,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-115 MAKE WAY FOR PRINCESS DOROTHY WHO COMES FROM OZMA OF OZ. HEARING THIS ANNOUNCEMENT THE THRONG OF RABBITS GAVE PLACE TO THEM ON THE WALKS AND AS DOROTHY PASSED ALONG THEY ALL BOWED THEIR HEADS RESPECTFULLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-116 WALKING THUS THROUGH SEVERAL HANDSOME STREETS THEY CAME TO A SQUARE IN THE CENTER OF THE CITY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-19-117 IN THIS SQUARE WERE SOME PRETTY TREES AND A STATUE IN BRONZE OF GLINDA THE GOOD WHILE BEYOND IT WERE THE PORTALS OF THE ROYAL PALACE AN EXTENSIVE AND IMPOSING BUILDING OF WHITE MARBLE COVERED WITH A FILIGREE OF FROSTED GOLD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-01 CHAPTER TWENTY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-02 HOW DOROTHY LUNCHED WITH A KING A LINE OF RABBIT SOLDIERS WAS DRAWN UP BEFORE THE PALACE ENTRANCE AND THEY WORE GREEN AND GOLD UNIFORMS WITH HIGH SHAKOS UPON THEIR HEADS AND HELD TINY SPEARS IN THEIR HANDS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-03 THE CAPTAIN HAD A SWORD AND A WHITE PLUME IN HIS SHAKO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-04 SALUTE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-05 THE KEEPER OF THE WICKET.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-06 SALUTE PRINCESS DOROTHY WHO COMES FROM OZMA OF OZ!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-07 SALUTE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-08 YELLED THE CAPTAIN AND ALL THE SOLDIERS PROMPTLY SALUTED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-09 THEY NOW ENTERED THE GREAT HALL OF THE PALACE WHERE THEY MET A GAILY DRESSED ATTENDANT FROM WHOM THE KEEPER OF THE WICKET INQUIRED IF THE KING WERE AT LEISURE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-10 I THINK SO WAS THE REPLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-11 I HEARD HIS MAJESTY BLUBBERING AND WAILING AS USUAL ONLY A FEW MINUTES AGO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-12 IF HE DOESN'T STOP ACTING LIKE A CRY BABY I'M GOING TO RESIGN MY POSITION HERE AND GO TO WORK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-13 WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOUR KING?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-14 ASKED DOROTHY SURPRISED TO HEAR THE RABBIT ATTENDANT SPEAK SO DISRESPECTFULLY OF HIS MONARCH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-15 OH HE DOESN'T WANT TO BE KING THAT'S ALL,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-16 AND HE SIMPLY HAS TO WAS THE REPLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-17 COME!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-18 SAID THE KEEPER OF THE WICKET STERNLY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-19 LEAD US TO HIS MAJESTY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-20 AND DO NOT AIR OUR TROUBLES BEFORE STRANGERS I BEG OF YOU.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-21 WHY IF THIS GIRL IS GOING TO SEE THE KING HE'LL AIR HIS OWN TROUBLES RETURNED THE ATTENDANT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-22 THAT IS HIS ROYAL PRIVILEGE DECLARED THE KEEPER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-23 SO THE ATTENDANT LED THEM INTO A ROOM ALL DRAPED WITH CLOTH OF GOLD AND FURNISHED WITH SATIN COVERED GOLD FURNITURE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-24 THERE WAS A THRONE IN THIS ROOM SET ON A DAIS AND HAVING A BIG CUSHIONED SEAT AND ON THIS SEAT RECLINED THE RABBIT KING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-25 HE WAS LYING ON HIS BACK WITH HIS PAWS IN THE AIR AND WHINING VERY LIKE A PUPPY DOG.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-26 YOUR MAJESTY!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-27 GET UP.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-28 HERE'S A VISITOR CALLED OUT THE ATTENDANT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-29 THE KING ROLLED OVER AND LOOKED AT DOROTHY WITH ONE WATERY PINK EYE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-30 THEN HE SAT UP AND WIPED HIS EYES CAREFULLY WITH A SILK HANDKERCHIEF AND PUT ON HIS JEWELED CROWN WHICH HAD FALLEN OFF.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-31 EXCUSE MY GRIEF FAIR STRANGER HE SAID IN A SAD VOICE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-32 YOU BEHOLD IN ME THE MOST MISERABLE MONARCH IN ALL THE WORLD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-33 WHAT TIME IS IT BLINKEM?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-34 ONE O'CLOCK YOUR MAJESTY REPLIED THE ATTENDANT TO WHOM THE QUESTION WAS ADDRESSED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-35 SERVE LUNCHEON AT ONCE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-36 COMMANDED THE KING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-37 LUNCHEON FOR TWO THAT'S FOR MY VISITOR AND ME AND SEE THAT THE HUMAN HAS SOME SORT OF FOOD SHE'S ACCUSTOMED TO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-38 YES YOUR MAJESTY ANSWERED THE ATTENDANT AND WENT AWAY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-39 TIE MY SHOE BRISTLE SAID THE KING TO THE KEEPER OF THE WICKET.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-40 AH ME!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-41 HOW UNHAPPY I AM!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-42 WHAT SEEMS TO BE WORRYING YOUR MAJESTY?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-43 DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-44 WHY IT'S THIS KING BUSINESS OF COURSE HE RETURNED WHILE THE KEEPER TIED HIS SHOE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-45 I DIDN'T WANT TO BE KING OF BUNNYBURY AT ALL AND THE RABBITS ALL KNEW IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-46 SO THEY ELECTED ME TO SAVE THEMSELVES FROM SUCH A DREADFUL FATE I SUPPOSE AND HERE I AM SHUT UP IN A PALACE WHEN I MIGHT BE FREE AND HAPPY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-47 SEEMS TO ME SAID DOROTHY IT'S A GREAT THING TO BE A KING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-48 WERE YOU EVER A KING?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-49 INQUIRED THE MONARCH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-50 NO SHE ANSWERED LAUGHING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-51 THEN YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT HE SAID.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-52 I HAVEN'T INQUIRED WHO YOU ARE BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-53 WHILE WE'RE AT LUNCHEON I'LL TELL YOU ALL MY TROUBLES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-54 THEY'RE A GREAT DEAL MORE INTERESTING THAN ANYTHING YOU CAN SAY ABOUT YOURSELF.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-55 PERHAPS THEY ARE TO YOU REPLIED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-56 LUNCHEON IS SERVED!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-57 CRIED BLINKEM THROWING OPEN THE DOOR AND IN CAME A DOZEN RABBITS IN LIVERY ALL BEARING TRAYS WHICH THEY PLACED UPON THE TABLE WHERE THEY ARRANGED THE DISHES IN AN ORDERLY MANNER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-58 NOW CLEAR OUT ALL OF YOU!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-59 EXCLAIMED THE KING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-60 BRISTLE YOU MAY WAIT OUTSIDE IN CASE I WANT YOU.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-61 WHEN THEY HAD GONE AND THE KING WAS ALONE WITH DOROTHY HE CAME DOWN FROM HIS THRONE TOSSED HIS CROWN INTO A CORNER AND KICKED HIS ERMINE ROBE UNDER THE TABLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-62 SIT DOWN HE SAID AND TRY TO BE HAPPY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-63 IT'S USELESS FOR ME TO TRY BECAUSE I'M ALWAYS WRETCHED AND MISERABLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-64 BUT I'M HUNGRY AND I HOPE YOU ARE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-65 I AM SAID DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-66 I'VE ONLY EATEN A WHEELBARROW AND A PIANO TO DAY OH YES!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-67 AND A SLICE OF BREAD AND BUTTER THAT USED TO BE A DOOR MAT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-68 THAT SOUNDS LIKE A SQUARE MEAL REMARKED THE KING SEATING HIMSELF OPPOSITE HER,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-69 BUT PERHAPS IT WASN'T A SQUARE PIANO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-70 EH?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-71 DOROTHY LAUGHED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-72 YOU DON'T SEEM SO VERY UNHAPPY NOW SHE SAID.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-73 BUT I AM PROTESTED THE KING FRESH TEARS GATHERING IN HIS EYES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-74 EVEN MY JOKES ARE MISERABLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-75 I'M WRETCHED WOEFUL AFFLICTED DISTRESSED AND DISMAL AS AN INDIVIDUAL CAN BE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-76 ARE YOU NOT SORRY FOR ME?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-77 NO ANSWERED DOROTHY HONESTLY I CAN'T SAY I AM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-78 SEEMS TO ME THAT FOR A RABBIT YOU'RE RIGHT IN CLOVER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-79 THIS IS THE PRETTIEST LITTLE CITY I EVER SAW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-80 OH THE CITY IS GOOD ENOUGH HE ADMITTED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-81 GLINDA THE GOOD SORCERESS MADE IT FOR US BECAUSE SHE WAS FOND OF RABBITS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-82 I DON'T MIND THE CITY SO MUCH ALTHOUGH I WOULDN'T LIVE HERE IF I HAD MY CHOICE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-83 IT IS BEING KING THAT HAS ABSOLUTELY RUINED MY HAPPINESS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-84 WHY WOULDN'T YOU LIVE HERE BY CHOICE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-85 SHE ASKED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-86 BECAUSE IT IS ALL UNNATURAL MY DEAR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-87 RABBITS ARE OUT OF PLACE IN SUCH LUXURY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-88 WHEN I WAS YOUNG I LIVED IN A BURROW IN THE FOREST.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-89 I WAS SURROUNDED BY ENEMIES AND OFTEN HAD TO RUN FOR MY LIFE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-90 IT WAS HARD GETTING ENOUGH TO EAT AT TIMES AND WHEN I FOUND A BUNCH OF CLOVER I HAD TO LISTEN AND LOOK FOR DANGER WHILE I ATE IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-91 WOLVES PROWLED AROUND THE HOLE IN WHICH I LIVED AND SOMETIMES I DIDN'T DARE STIR OUT FOR DAYS AT A TIME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-92 OH HOW HAPPY AND CONTENTED I WAS THEN!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-93 I WAS A REAL RABBIT AS NATURE MADE ME WILD AND FREE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-94 AND I EVEN ENJOYED LISTENING TO THE STARTLED THROBBING OF MY OWN HEART!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-95 I'VE OFTEN THOUGHT SAID DOROTHY WHO WAS BUSILY EATING THAT IT WOULD BE FUN TO BE A RABBIT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-96 IT IS FUN WHEN YOU'RE THE GENUINE ARTICLE AGREED HIS MAJESTY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-97 BUT LOOK AT ME NOW!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-98 I LIVE IN A MARBLE PALACE INSTEAD OF A HOLE IN THE GROUND.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-99 I HAVE ALL I WANT TO EAT WITHOUT THE JOY OF HUNTING FOR IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-100 EVERY DAY I MUST DRESS IN FINE CLOTHES AND WEAR THAT HORRIBLE CROWN TILL IT MAKES MY HEAD ACHE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-101 RABBITS COME TO ME WITH ALL SORTS OF TROUBLES WHEN MY OWN TROUBLES ARE THE ONLY ONES I CARE ABOUT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-102 WHEN I WALK OUT I CAN'T HOP AND RUN,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-103 I MUST STRUT ON MY REAR LEGS AND WEAR AN ERMINE ROBE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-104 THE SOLDIERS SALUTE ME AND THE BAND PLAYS AND THE OTHER RABBITS LAUGH AND CLAP THEIR PAWS AND CRY OUT, HAIL TO THE KING!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-105 NOW LET ME ASK YOU AS A FRIEND AND A YOUNG LADY OF GOOD JUDGMENT, ISN'T ALL THIS POMP AND FOOLISHNESS ENOUGH TO MAKE A DECENT RABBIT MISERABLE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-106 ONCE SAID DOROTHY REFLECTIVELY MEN WERE WILD AND UNCLOTHED AND LIVED IN CAVES AND HUNTED FOR FOOD AS WILD BEASTS DO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-107 BUT THEY GOT CIV'LIZED IN TIME AND NOW THEY'D HATE TO GO BACK TO THE OLD DAYS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-108 THAT IS AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT CASE REPLIED THE KING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-109 NONE OF YOU HUMANS WERE CIVILIZED IN ONE LIFETIME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-110 IT CAME TO YOU BY DEGREES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-111 BUT I HAVE KNOWN THE FOREST AND THE FREE LIFE AND THAT IS WHY I RESENT BEING CIVILIZED ALL AT ONCE AGAINST MY WILL AND BEING MADE A KING WITH A CROWN AND AN ERMINE ROBE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-112 PAH!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-113 IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT WHY DON'T YOU RESIGN?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-114 SHE ASKED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-115 IMPOSSIBLE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-116 WAILED THE RABBIT WIPING HIS EYES AGAIN WITH HIS HANDKERCHIEF.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-117 THERE'S A BEASTLY LAW IN THIS TOWN THAT FORBIDS IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-118 WHEN ONE IS ELECTED A KING THERE'S NO GETTING OUT OF IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-119 WHO MADE THE LAWS?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-120 INQUIRED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-121 THE SAME SORCERESS WHO MADE THE TOWN GLINDA THE GOOD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-122 SHE BUILT THE WALL AND FIXED UP THE CITY AND GAVE US SEVERAL VALUABLE ENCHANTMENTS AND MADE THE LAWS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-123 THEN SHE INVITED ALL THE PINK EYED WHITE RABBITS OF THE FOREST TO COME HERE AFTER WHICH SHE LEFT US TO OUR FATE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-124 WHAT MADE YOU CEPT THE INVITATION AND COME HERE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-125 ASKED THE CHILD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-126 I DIDN'T KNOW HOW DREADFUL CITY LIFE WAS AND I'D NO IDEA I WOULD BE ELECTED KING SAID HE SOBBING BITTERLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-127 AND AND NOW I'M IT WITH A CAPITAL I AND CAN'T ESCAPE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-128 I KNOW GLINDA REMARKED DOROTHY EATING FOR DESSERT A DISH OF CHARLOTTE RUSSE AND WHEN I SEE HER AGAIN I'LL ASK HER TO PUT ANOTHER KING IN YOUR PLACE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-129 WILL YOU?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-130 WILL YOU INDEED?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-131 ASKED THE KING JOYFULLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-132 I WILL IF YOU WANT ME TO SHE REPLIED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-133 HURROO HURAY!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-134 SHOUTED THE KING,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-135 AND THEN HE JUMPED UP FROM THE TABLE AND DANCED WILDLY ABOUT THE ROOM WAVING HIS NAPKIN LIKE A FLAG AND LAUGHING WITH GLEE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-136 AFTER A TIME HE MANAGED TO CONTROL HIS DELIGHT AND RETURNED TO THE TABLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-137 WHEN ARE YOU LIKELY TO SEE GLINDA?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-138 HE INQUIRED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-139 OH P'RAPS IN A FEW DAYS SAID DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-140 AND YOU WON'T FORGET TO ASK HER?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-141 OF COURSE NOT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-142 PRINCESS SAID THE RABBIT KING EARNESTLY YOU HAVE RELIEVED ME OF A GREAT UNHAPPINESS AND I AM VERY GRATEFUL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-143 THEREFORE I PROPOSE TO ENTERTAIN YOU SINCE YOU ARE MY GUEST AND I AM THE KING AS A SLIGHT MARK OF MY APPRECIATION.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-144 COME WITH ME TO MY RECEPTION HALL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-145 HE THEN SUMMONED BRISTLE AND SAID TO HIM, ASSEMBLE ALL THE NOBILITY IN THE GREAT RECEPTION HALL AND ALSO TELL BLINKEM THAT I WANT HIM IMMEDIATELY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-146 THE KEEPER OF THE WICKET BOWED AND HURRIED AWAY AND HIS MAJESTY TURNED TO DOROTHY AND CONTINUED, WE'LL HAVE TIME FOR A WALK IN THE GARDENS BEFORE THE PEOPLE GET HERE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-147 THE GARDENS WERE BACK OF THE PALACE AND WERE FILLED WITH BEAUTIFUL FLOWERS AND FRAGRANT SHRUBS WITH MANY SHADE AND FRUIT TREES AND MARBLE PAVED WALKS RUNNING IN EVERY DIRECTION.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-148 AS THEY ENTERED THIS PLACE BLINKEM CAME RUNNING TO THE KING WHO GAVE HIM SEVERAL ORDERS IN A LOW VOICE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-149 THEN HIS MAJESTY REJOINED DOROTHY AND LED HER THROUGH THE GARDENS WHICH SHE ADMIRED VERY MUCH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-150 WHAT LOVELY CLOTHES YOUR MAJESTY WEARS!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-151 SHE SAID GLANCING AT THE RICH BLUE SATIN COSTUME EMBROIDERED WITH PEARLS IN WHICH THE KING WAS DRESSED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-152 YES HE RETURNED WITH AN AIR OF PRIDE THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE SUITS,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-153 BUT I HAVE A GOOD MANY THAT ARE EVEN MORE ELABORATE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-154 WE HAVE EXCELLENT TAILORS IN BUNNYBURY AND GLINDA SUPPLIES ALL THE MATERIAL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-155 BY THE WAY YOU MIGHT ASK THE SORCERESS WHEN YOU SEE HER TO PERMIT ME TO KEEP MY WARDROBE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-156 BUT IF YOU GO BACK TO THE FOREST YOU WILL NOT NEED CLOTHES SHE SAID.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-157 N O!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-158 HE FALTERED,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-159 THAT MAY BE SO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-160 BUT I'VE DRESSED UP SO LONG THAT I'M USED TO IT AND I DON'T IMAGINE I'D CARE TO RUN AROUND NAKED AGAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-161 SO PERHAPS THE GOOD GLINDA WILL LET ME KEEP THE COSTUMES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-162 I'LL ASK HER AGREED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-163 THEN THEY LEFT THE GARDENS AND WENT INTO A FINE BIG RECEPTION HALL WHERE RICH RUGS WERE SPREAD UPON THE TILED FLOORS AND THE FURNITURE WAS EXQUISITELY CARVED AND STUDDED WITH JEWELS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-164 THE KING'S CHAIR WAS AN ESPECIALLY PRETTY PIECE OF FURNITURE BEING IN THE SHAPE OF A SILVER LILY WITH ONE LEAF BENT OVER TO FORM THE SEAT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-165 THE SILVER WAS EVERYWHERE THICKLY ENCRUSTED WITH DIAMONDS AND THE SEAT WAS UPHOLSTERED IN WHITE SATIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-166 OH WHAT A SPLENDID CHAIR!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-167 CRIED DOROTHY CLASPING HER HANDS ADMIRINGLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-168 ISN'T IT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-169 ANSWERED THE KING PROUDLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-170 IT IS MY FAVORITE SEAT AND I THINK IT ESPECIALLY BECOMING TO MY COMPLEXION.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-171 WHILE I THINK OF IT I WISH YOU'D ASK GLINDA TO LET ME KEEP THIS LILY CHAIR WHEN I GO AWAY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-172 IT WOULDN'T LOOK VERY WELL IN A HOLE IN THE GROUND WOULD IT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-173 SHE SUGGESTED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-174 MAYBE NOT,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-175 BUT I'M USED TO SITTING IN IT AND I'D LIKE TO TAKE IT WITH ME HE ANSWERED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-176 BUT HERE COME THE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE COURT,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-20-177 SO PLEASE SIT BESIDE ME AND BE PRESENTED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-01 CHAPTER TWENTY ONE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-02 HOW THE KING CHANGED HIS MIND JUST THEN A RABBIT BAND OF NEARLY FIFTY PIECES MARCHED IN PLAYING UPON GOLDEN INSTRUMENTS AND DRESSED IN NEAT UNIFORMS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-03 FOLLOWING THE BAND CAME THE NOBILITY OF BUNNYBURY ALL RICHLY DRESSED AND HOPPING ALONG ON THEIR REAR LEGS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-04 BOTH THE LADIES AND THE GENTLEMEN WORE WHITE GLOVES UPON THEIR PAWS WITH THEIR RINGS ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE GLOVES AS THIS SEEMED TO BE THE FASHION HERE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-05 SOME OF THE LADY RABBITS CARRIED LORGNETTES WHILE MANY OF THE GENTLEMEN RABBITS WORE MONOCLES IN THEIR LEFT EYES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-06 THE COURTIERS AND THEIR LADIES PARADED PAST THE KING WHO INTRODUCED PRINCESS DOROTHY TO EACH COUPLE IN A VERY GRACEFUL MANNER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-07 THEN THE COMPANY SEATED THEMSELVES IN CHAIRS AND ON SOFAS AND LOOKED EXPECTANTLY AT THEIR MONARCH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-08 IT IS OUR ROYAL DUTY AS WELL AS OUR ROYAL PLEASURE HE SAID TO PROVIDE FITTING ENTERTAINMENT FOR OUR DISTINGUISHED GUEST.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-09 WE WILL NOW PRESENT THE ROYAL BAND OF WHISKERED FRISKERS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-10 AS HE SPOKE THE MUSICIANS WHO HAD ARRANGED THEMSELVES IN A CORNER STRUCK UP A DANCE MELODY WHILE INTO THE ROOM PRANCED THE WHISKERED FRISKERS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-11 THEY WERE EIGHT PRETTY RABBITS DRESSED ONLY IN GAUZY PURPLE SKIRTS FASTENED AROUND THEIR WAISTS WITH DIAMOND BANDS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-12 THEIR WHISKERS WERE COLORED A RICH PURPLE BUT OTHERWISE THEY WERE PURE WHITE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-13 AFTER BOWING BEFORE THE KING AND DOROTHY THE FRISKERS BEGAN THEIR PRANKS AND THESE WERE SO COMICAL THAT DOROTHY LAUGHED WITH REAL ENJOYMENT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-14 THEY NOT ONLY DANCED TOGETHER WHIRLING AND GYRATING AROUND THE ROOM BUT THEY LEAPED OVER ONE ANOTHER STOOD UPON THEIR HEADS AND HOPPED AND SKIPPED HERE AND THERE SO NIMBLY THAT IT WAS HARD WORK TO KEEP TRACK OF THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-15 FINALLY THEY ALL MADE DOUBLE SOMERSAULTS AND TURNED HANDSPRINGS OUT OF THE ROOM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-16 THE NOBILITY ENTHUSIASTICALLY APPLAUDED AND DOROTHY APPLAUDED WITH THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-17 THEY'RE FINE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-18 SHE SAID TO THE KING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-19 YES THE WHISKERED FRISKERS ARE REALLY VERY CLEVER HE REPLIED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-20 I SHALL HATE TO PART WITH THEM WHEN I GO AWAY FOR THEY HAVE OFTEN AMUSED ME WHEN I WAS VERY MISERABLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-21 I WONDER IF YOU WOULD ASK GLINDA NO IT WOULDN'T DO AT ALL DECLARED DOROTHY POSITIVELY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-22 THERE WOULDN'T BE ROOM IN YOUR HOLE IN THE GROUND FOR SO MANY RABBITS SPEC'LY WHEN YOU GET THE LILY CHAIR AND YOUR CLOTHES THERE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-23 DON'T THINK OF SUCH A THING YOUR MAJESTY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-24 THE KING SIGHED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-25 THEN HE STOOD UP AND ANNOUNCED TO THE COMPANY, WE WILL NOW HOLD A MILITARY DRILL BY MY PICKED BODYGUARD OF ROYAL PIKEMEN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-26 NOW THE BAND PLAYED A MARCH AND A COMPANY OF RABBIT SOLDIERS CAME IN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-27 THEY WORE GREEN AND GOLD UNIFORMS AND MARCHED VERY STIFFLY BUT IN PERFECT TIME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-28 THEIR SPEARS OR PIKES HAD SLENDER SHAFTS OF POLISHED SILVER WITH GOLDEN HEADS AND DURING THE DRILL THEY HANDLED THESE WEAPONS WITH WONDERFUL DEXTERITY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-29 I SHOULD THINK YOU'D FEEL PRETTY SAFE WITH SUCH A FINE BODYGUARD REMARKED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-30 I DO SAID THE KING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-31 THEY PROTECT ME FROM EVERY HARM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-32 I SUPPOSE GLINDA WOULDN'T NO INTERRUPTED THE GIRL,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-33 I'M SURE SHE WOULDN'T.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-34 IT'S THE KING'S OWN BODYGUARD AND WHEN YOU ARE NO LONGER KING YOU CAN'T HAVE EM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-35 THE KING DID NOT REPLY BUT HE LOOKED RATHER SORROWFUL FOR A TIME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-36 WHEN THE SOLDIERS HAD MARCHED OUT HE SAID TO THE COMPANY, THE ROYAL JUGGLERS WILL NOW APPEAR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-37 DOROTHY HAD SEEN MANY JUGGLERS IN HER LIFETIME BUT NEVER ANY SO INTERESTING AS THESE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-38 THERE WERE SIX OF THEM DRESSED IN BLACK SATIN EMBROIDERED WITH QUEER SYMBOLS IN SILVER A COSTUME WHICH CONTRASTED STRONGLY WITH THEIR SNOW WHITE FUR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-39 FIRST THEY PUSHED IN A BIG RED BALL AND THREE OF THE RABBIT JUGGLERS STOOD UPON ITS TOP AND MADE IT ROLL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-40 THEN TWO OF THEM CAUGHT UP A THIRD AND TOSSED HIM INTO THE AIR ALL VANISHING UNTIL ONLY THE TWO WERE LEFT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-41 THEN ONE OF THESE TOSSED THE OTHER UPWARD AND REMAINED ALONE OF ALL HIS FELLOWS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-42 THIS LAST JUGGLER NOW TOUCHED THE RED BALL WHICH FELL APART BEING HOLLOW AND THE FIVE RABBITS WHO HAD DISAPPEARED IN THE AIR SCRAMBLED OUT OF THE HOLLOW BALL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-43 NEXT THEY ALL CLUNG TOGETHER AND ROLLED SWIFTLY UPON THE FLOOR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-44 WHEN THEY CAME TO A STOP ONLY ONE FAT RABBIT JUGGLER WAS SEEN THE OTHERS SEEMING TO BE INSIDE HIM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-45 THIS ONE LEAPED LIGHTLY INTO THE AIR AND WHEN HE CAME DOWN HE EXPLODED AND SEPARATED INTO THE ORIGINAL SIX.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-46 THEN FOUR OF THEM ROLLED THEMSELVES INTO ROUND BALLS AND THE OTHER TWO TOSSED THEM AROUND AND PLAYED BALL WITH THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-47 THESE WERE BUT A FEW OF THE TRICKS THE RABBIT JUGGLERS PERFORMED AND THEY WERE SO SKILLFUL THAT ALL THE NOBILITY AND EVEN THE KING APPLAUDED AS LOUDLY AS DID DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-48 I SUPPOSE THERE ARE NO RABBIT JUGGLERS IN ALL THE WORLD TO COMPARE WITH THESE REMARKED THE KING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-49 AND SINCE I MAY NOT HAVE THE WHISKERS FRISKERS OR MY BODYGUARD YOU MIGHT ASK GLINDA TO LET ME TAKE AWAY JUST TWO OR THREE OF THESE JUGGLERS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-50 WILL YOU?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-51 I'LL ASK HER REPLIED DOROTHY DOUBTFULLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-52 THANK YOU SAID THE KING,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-53 THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-54 AND NOW YOU SHALL LISTEN TO THE WINSOME WAGGISH WARBLERS WHO HAVE OFTEN CHEERED ME IN MY MOMENTS OF ANGUISH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-55 THE WINSOME WAGGISH WARBLERS PROVED TO BE A QUARTETTE OF RABBIT SINGERS TWO GENTLEMEN AND TWO LADY RABBITS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-56 THE GENTLEMEN WARBLERS WORE FULL DRESS SWALLOW TAILED SUITS OF WHITE SATIN WITH PEARLS FOR BUTTONS WHILE THE LADY WARBLERS WERE GOWNED IN WHITE SATIN DRESSES WITH LONG TRAILS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-57 THE FIRST SONG THEY SANG BEGAN IN THIS WAY, WHEN A RABBIT GETS A HABIT OF LIVING IN A CITY AND WEARING CLOTHES AND FURBELOWS AND JEWELS RARE AND PRETTY HE SCORNS THE BUN WHO HAS TO RUN AND BURROW IN THE GROUND AND PITIES THOSE WHOSE WATCHFUL FOES ARE MAN AND GUN AND HOUND.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-58 DOROTHY LOOKED AT THE KING WHEN SHE HEARD THIS SONG AND NOTICED THAT HE SEEMED DISTURBED AND ILL AT EASE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-59 I DON'T LIKE THAT SONG HE SAID TO THE WARBLERS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-60 GIVE US SOMETHING JOLLY AND ROLLICKING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-61 SO THEY SANG TO A JOYOUS TINKLING MELODY AS FOLLOWS, BUNNIES GAY DELIGHT TO PLAY IN THEIR FAIRY TOWN SECURE,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-62 EV'RY FRISKER FLIRTS HIS WHISKER AT A PINK EYED GIRL DEMURE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-63 EV'RY MAID IN SILK ARRAYED AT HER PARTNER SHYLY GLANCES PAWS ARE GRASPED WAISTS ARE CLASPED AS THEY WHIRL IN GIDDY DANCES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-64 THEN TOGETHER THROUGH THE HEATHER NEATH THE MOONLIGHT SOFT THEY STROLL,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-65 EACH IS VERY BLITHE AND MERRY GAMBOLING WITH LAUGHTER DROLL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-66 LIFE IS FUN TO EV'RY ONE GUARDED BY OUR MAGIC CHARM FOR TO DANGERS WE ARE STRANGERS SAFE FROM ANY THOUGHT OF HARM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-67 YOU SEE SAID DOROTHY TO THE KING WHEN THE SONG ENDED THE RABBITS ALL SEEM TO LIKE BUNNYBURY EXCEPT YOU.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-68 AND I GUESS YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE THAT EVER HAS CRIED OR WAS UNHAPPY AND WANTED TO GET BACK TO YOUR MUDDY HOLE IN THE GROUND.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-69 HIS MAJESTY SEEMED THOUGHTFUL AND WHILE THE SERVANTS PASSED AROUND GLASSES OF NECTAR AND PLATES OF FROSTED CAKES THEIR KING WAS SILENT AND A BIT NERVOUS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-70 WHEN THE REFRESHMENTS HAD BEEN ENJOYED BY ALL AND THE SERVANTS HAD RETIRED DOROTHY SAID, I MUST GO NOW FOR IT'S GETTING LATE AND I'M LOST.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-71 I'VE GOT TO FIND THE WIZARD AND AUNT EM AND UNCLE HENRY AND ALL THE REST SOMETIME BEFORE NIGHT COMES IF I POSS'BLY CAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-72 WON'T YOU STAY WITH US?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-73 ASKED THE KING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-74 YOU WILL BE VERY WELCOME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-75 NO THANK YOU SHE REPLIED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-76 I MUST GET BACK TO MY FRIENDS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-77 AND I WANT TO SEE GLINDA JUST AS SOON AS I CAN YOU KNOW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-78 SO THE KING DISMISSED HIS COURT AND SAID HE WOULD HIMSELF WALK WITH DOROTHY TO THE GATE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-79 HE DID NOT WEEP NOR GROAN ANY MORE BUT HIS LONG FACE WAS QUITE SOLEMN AND HIS BIG EARS HUNG DEJECTEDLY ON EACH SIDE OF IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-80 HE STILL WORE HIS CROWN AND HIS ERMINE AND WALKED WITH A HANDSOME GOLD HEADED CANE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-81 WHEN THEY ARRIVED AT THE ROOM IN THE WALL THE LITTLE GIRL FOUND TOTO AND BILLINA WAITING FOR HER VERY PATIENTLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-82 THEY HAD BEEN LIBERALLY FED BY SOME OF THE ATTENDANTS AND WERE IN NO HURRY TO LEAVE SUCH COMFORTABLE QUARTERS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-83 THE KEEPER OF THE WICKET WAS BY THIS TIME BACK IN HIS OLD PLACE BUT HE KEPT A SAFE DISTANCE FROM TOTO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-84 DOROTHY BADE GOOD BYE TO THE KING AS THEY STOOD JUST INSIDE THE WALL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-85 YOU'VE BEEN GOOD TO ME SHE SAID AND I THANK YOU EVER SO MUCH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-86 AS SOON AS POSS'BLE I'LL SEE GLINDA AND ASK HER TO PUT ANOTHER KING IN YOUR PLACE AND SEND YOU BACK INTO THE WILD FOREST.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-87 AND I'LL ASK HER TO LET YOU KEEP SOME OF YOUR CLOTHES AND THE LILY CHAIR AND ONE OR TWO JUGGLERS TO AMUSE YOU.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-88 I'M SURE SHE WILL DO IT CAUSE SHE'S SO KIND SHE DOESN'T LIKE ANY ONE TO BE UNHAPPY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-89 AHEM!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-90 SAID THE KING LOOKING RATHER DOWNCAST.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-91 I DON'T LIKE TO TROUBLE YOU WITH MY MISERY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-92 SO YOU NEEDN'T SEE GLINDA.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-93 OH YES I WILL SHE REPLIED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-94 IT WON'T BE ANY TROUBLE AT ALL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-95 BUT MY DEAR CONTINUED THE KING IN AN EMBARRASSED WAY I'VE BEEN THINKING THE SUBJECT OVER CAREFULLY AND I FIND THERE ARE A LOT OF PLEASANT THINGS HERE IN BUNNYBURY THAT I WOULD MISS IF I WENT AWAY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-96 SO PERHAPS I'D BETTER STAY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-97 DOROTHY LAUGHED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-98 THEN SHE LOOKED GRAVE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-99 IT WON'T DO FOR YOU TO BE A KING AND A CRY BABY AT THE SAME TIME SHE SAID.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-100 YOU'VE BEEN MAKING ALL THE OTHER RABBITS UNHAPPY AND DISCONTENTED WITH YOUR HOWLS ABOUT BEING SO MISERABLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-101 SO I GUESS IT'S BETTER TO HAVE ANOTHER KING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-102 OH NO INDEED!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-103 EXCLAIMED THE KING EARNESTLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-104 IF YOU WON'T SAY ANYTHING TO GLINDA I'LL PROMISE TO BE MERRY AND GAY ALL THE TIME AND NEVER CRY OR WAIL AGAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-105 HONOR BRIGHT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-106 SHE ASKED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-107 ON THE ROYAL WORD OF A KING I PROMISE IT!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-108 HE ANSWERED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-109 ALL RIGHT SAID DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-110 YOU'D BE A REG'LAR LUNATIC TO WANT TO LEAVE BUNNYBURY FOR A WILD LIFE IN THE FOREST AND I'M SURE ANY RABBIT OUTSIDE THE CITY WOULD BE GLAD TO TAKE YOUR PLACE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-111 FORGET IT MY DEAR,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-112 FORGET ALL MY FOOLISHNESS PLEADED THE KING EARNESTLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-113 HEREAFTER I'LL TRY TO ENJOY MYSELF AND DO MY DUTY BY MY SUBJECTS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-114 SO THEN SHE LEFT HIM AND ENTERED THROUGH THE LITTLE DOOR INTO THE ROOM IN THE WALL WHERE SHE GREW GRADUALLY BIGGER AND BIGGER UNTIL SHE HAD RESUMED HER NATURAL SIZE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-115 THE KEEPER OF THE WICKET LET THEM OUT INTO THE FOREST AND TOLD DOROTHY THAT SHE HAD BEEN OF GREAT SERVICE TO BUNNYBURY BECAUSE SHE HAD BROUGHT THEIR DISMAL KING TO A REALIZATION OF THE PLEASURE OF RULING SO BEAUTIFUL A CITY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-116 I SHALL START A PETITION TO HAVE YOUR STATUE ERECTED BESIDE GLINDA'S IN THE PUBLIC SQUARE SAID THE KEEPER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-117 I HOPE YOU WILL COME AGAIN SOME DAY AND SEE IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-118 PERHAPS I SHALL SHE REPLIED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-21-119 THEN FOLLOWED BY TOTO AND BILLINA SHE WALKED AWAY FROM THE HIGH MARBLE WALL AND STARTED BACK ALONG THE NARROW PATH TOWARD THE SIGN POST.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-01 CHAPTER TWENTY TWO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-02 HOW THE WIZARD FOUND DOROTHY WHEN THEY CAME TO THE SIGNPOST THERE TO THEIR JOY WERE THE TENTS OF THE WIZARD PITCHED BESIDE THE PATH AND THE KETTLE BUBBLING MERRILY OVER THE FIRE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-03 THE SHAGGY MAN AND OMBY AMBY WERE GATHERING FIREWOOD WHILE UNCLE HENRY AND AUNT EM SAT IN THEIR CAMP CHAIRS TALKING WITH THE WIZARD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-04 THEY ALL RAN FORWARD TO GREET DOROTHY AS SHE APPROACHED AND AUNT EM EXCLAIMED, GOODNESS GRACIOUS CHILD!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-05 WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-06 YOU'VE PLAYED HOOKEY THE WHOLE DAY ADDED THE SHAGGY MAN REPROACHFULLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-07 WELL YOU SEE I'VE BEEN LOST EXPLAINED THE LITTLE GIRL AND I'VE TRIED AWFUL HARD TO FIND THE WAY BACK TO YOU BUT JUST COULDN'T DO IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-08 DID YOU WANDER IN THE FOREST ALL DAY?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-09 ASKED UNCLE HENRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-10 YOU MUST BE A'MOST STARVED!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-11 SAID AUNT EM. NO SAID DOROTHY I'M NOT HUNGRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-12 I HAD A WHEELBARROW AND A PIANO FOR BREAKFAST AND LUNCHED WITH A KING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-13 AH!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-14 EXCLAIMED THE WIZARD NODDING WITH A BRIGHT SMILE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-15 SO YOU'VE BEEN HAVING ADVENTURES AGAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-16 SHE'S STARK CRAZY!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-17 CRIED AUNT EM. WHOEVER HEARD OF EATING A WHEELBARROW?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-18 IT WASN'T VERY BIG SAID DOROTHY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-19 AND IT HAD A ZUZU WHEEL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-20 AND I ATE THE CRUMBS SAID BILLINA SOBERLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-21 SIT DOWN AND TELL US ABOUT IT BEGGED THE WIZARD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-22 WE'VE HUNTED FOR YOU ALL DAY AND AT LAST I NOTICED YOUR FOOTSTEPS IN THIS PATH AND THE TRACKS OF BILLINA.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-23 WE FOUND THE PATH BY ACCIDENT AND SEEING IT ONLY LED TO TWO PLACES I DECIDED YOU WERE AT EITHER ONE OR THE OTHER OF THOSE PLACES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-24 SO WE MADE CAMP AND WAITED FOR YOU TO RETURN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-25 AND NOW DOROTHY TELL US WHERE YOU HAVE BEEN TO BUNBURY OR TO BUNNYBURY?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-26 WHY I'VE BEEN TO BOTH SHE REPLIED,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-27 BUT FIRST I WENT TO UTENSIA WHICH ISN'T ON ANY PATH AT ALL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-28 SHE THEN SAT DOWN AND RELATED THE DAY'S ADVENTURES AND YOU MAY BE SURE AUNT EM AND UNCLE HENRY WERE MUCH ASTONISHED AT THE STORY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-29 BUT AFTER SEEING THE CUTTENCLIPS AND THE FUDDLES REMARKED HER UNCLE WE OUGHT NOT TO WONDER AT ANYTHING IN THIS STRANGE COUNTRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-30 SEEMS LIKE THE ONLY COMMON AND ORDINARY FOLKS HERE ARE OURSELVES REJOINED AUNT EM DIFFIDENTLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-31 NOW THAT WE'RE TOGETHER AGAIN AND ONE REUNITED PARTY OBSERVED THE SHAGGY MAN WHAT ARE WE TO DO NEXT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-32 HAVE SOME SUPPER AND A NIGHT'S REST ANSWERED THE WIZARD PROMPTLY AND THEN PROCEED UPON OUR JOURNEY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-33 WHERE TO?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-34 ASKED THE CAPTAIN GENERAL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-35 WE HAVEN'T VISITED THE RIGMAROLES OR THE FLUTTERBUDGETS YET SAID DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-36 I'D LIKE TO SEE THEM WOULDN'T YOU?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-37 THEY DON'T SOUND VERY INTERESTING OBJECTED AUNT EM. BUT PERHAPS THEY ARE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-38 AND THEN CONTINUED THE LITTLE WIZARD WE WILL CALL UPON THE TIN WOODMAN AND JACK PUMPKINHEAD AND OUR OLD FRIEND THE SCARECROW ON OUR WAY HOME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-39 THAT WILL BE NICE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-40 CRIED DOROTHY EAGERLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-41 CAN'T SAY THEY SOUND VERY INTERESTING EITHER REMARKED AUNT EM. WHY THEY'RE THE BEST FRIENDS I HAVE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-42 ASSERTED THE LITTLE GIRL AND YOU'RE SURE TO LIKE THEM AUNT EM CAUSE EVER'BODY LIKES THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-43 BY THIS TIME TWILIGHT WAS APPROACHING SO THEY ATE THE FINE SUPPER WHICH THE WIZARD MAGICALLY PRODUCED FROM THE KETTLE AND THEN WENT TO BED IN THE COZY TENTS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-44 THEY WERE ALL UP BRIGHT AND EARLY NEXT MORNING BUT DOROTHY DIDN'T VENTURE TO WANDER FROM THE CAMP AGAIN FOR FEAR OF MORE ACCIDENTS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-45 DO YOU KNOW WHERE THERE'S A ROAD?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-46 SHE ASKED THE LITTLE MAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-47 NO MY DEAR REPLIED THE WIZARD,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-48 BUT I'LL FIND ONE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-49 AFTER BREAKFAST HE WAVED HIS HAND TOWARD THE TENTS AND THEY BECAME HANDKERCHIEFS AGAIN WHICH WERE AT ONCE RETURNED TO THE POCKETS OF THEIR OWNERS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-50 THEN THEY ALL CLIMBED INTO THE RED WAGON AND THE SAWHORSE INQUIRED, WHICH WAY?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-51 NEVER MIND WHICH WAY REPLIED THE WIZARD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-52 JUST GO AS YOU PLEASE AND YOU'RE SURE TO BE RIGHT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-53 I'VE ENCHANTED THE WHEELS OF THE WAGON AND THEY WILL ROLL IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION NEVER FEAR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-54 AS THE SAWHORSE STARTED AWAY THROUGH THE TREES DOROTHY SAID, IF WE HAD ONE OF THOSE NEW FASHIONED AIRSHIPS WE COULD FLOAT AWAY OVER THE TOP OF THE FOREST AND LOOK DOWN AND FIND JUST THE PLACES WE WANT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-55 RETORTED THE LITTLE MAN SCORNFULLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-56 I HATE THOSE THINGS DOROTHY ALTHOUGH THEY ARE NOTHING NEW TO EITHER YOU OR ME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-57 I WAS A BALLOONIST FOR MANY YEARS AND ONCE MY BALLOON CARRIED ME TO THE LAND OF OZ AND ONCE TO THE VEGETABLE KINGDOM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-58 AND ONCE OZMA HAD A GUMP THAT FLEW ALL OVER THIS KINGDOM AND HAD SENSE ENOUGH TO GO WHERE IT WAS TOLD TO WHICH AIRSHIPS WON'T DO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-59 THE HOUSE WHICH THE CYCLONE BROUGHT TO OZ ALL THE WAY FROM KANSAS WITH YOU AND TOTO IN IT WAS A REAL AIRSHIP AT THE TIME,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-60 SO YOU SEE WE'VE GOT PLENTY OF EXPERIENCE FLYING WITH THE BIRDS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-61 AIRSHIPS ARE NOT SO BAD AFTER ALL DECLARED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-62 SOME DAY THEY'LL FLY ALL OVER THE WORLD AND PERHAPS BRING PEOPLE EVEN TO THE LAND OF OZ. I MUST SPEAK TO OZMA ABOUT THAT SAID THE WIZARD WITH A SLIGHT FROWN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-63 IT WOULDN'T DO AT ALL YOU KNOW FOR THE EMERALD CITY TO BECOME A WAY STATION ON AN AIRSHIP LINE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-64 NO SAID DOROTHY I DON'T S'POSE IT WOULD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-65 BUT WHAT CAN WE DO TO PREVENT IT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-66 I'M WORKING OUT A MAGIC RECIPE TO FUDDLE MEN'S BRAINS SO THEY'LL NEVER MAKE AN AIRSHIP THAT WILL GO WHERE THEY WANT IT TO GO THE WIZARD CONFIDED TO HER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-67 THAT WON'T KEEP THE THINGS FROM FLYING NOW AND THEN BUT IT'LL KEEP THEM FROM FLYING TO THE LAND OF OZ. JUST THEN THE SAWHORSE DREW THE WAGON OUT OF THE FOREST AND A BEAUTIFUL LANDSCAPE LAY SPREAD BEFORE THE TRAVELERS EYES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-68 MOREOVER RIGHT BEFORE THEM WAS A GOOD ROAD THAT WOUND AWAY THROUGH THE HILLS AND VALLEYS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-69 NOW SAID THE WIZARD WITH EVIDENT DELIGHT WE ARE ON THE RIGHT TRACK AGAIN AND THERE IS NOTHING MORE TO WORRY ABOUT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-70 IT'S A FOOLISH THING TO TAKE CHANCES IN A STRANGE COUNTRY OBSERVED THE SHAGGY MAN. HAD WE KEPT TO THE ROADS WE NEVER WOULD HAVE BEEN LOST.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-71 ROADS ALWAYS LEAD TO SOME PLACE ELSE THEY WOULDN'T BE ROADS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-72 THIS ROAD ADDED THE WIZARD LEADS TO RIGMAROLE TOWN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-73 I'M SURE OF THAT BECAUSE I ENCHANTED THE WAGON WHEELS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-74 SURE ENOUGH AFTER RIDING ALONG THE ROAD FOR AN HOUR OR TWO THEY ENTERED A PRETTY VALLEY WHERE A VILLAGE WAS NESTLED AMONG THE HILLS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-75 THE HOUSES WERE MUNCHKIN SHAPED FOR THEY WERE ALL DOMES WITH WINDOWS WIDER THAN THEY WERE HIGH AND PRETTY BALCONIES OVER THE FRONT DOORS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-76 AUNT EM WAS GREATLY RELIEVED TO FIND THIS TOWN NEITHER PAPER NOR PATCH WORK AND THE ONLY SURPRISING THING ABOUT IT WAS THAT IT WAS SO FAR DISTANT FROM ALL OTHER TOWNS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-77 AS THE SAWHORSE DREW THE WAGON INTO THE MAIN STREET THE TRAVELERS NOTICED THAT THE PLACE WAS FILLED WITH PEOPLE STANDING IN GROUPS AND SEEMING TO BE ENGAGED IN EARNEST CONVERSATION.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-78 SO OCCUPIED WITH THEMSELVES WERE THE INHABITANTS THAT THEY SCARCELY NOTICED THE STRANGERS AT ALL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-79 SO THE WIZARD STOPPED A BOY AND ASKED, IS THIS RIGMAROLE TOWN?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-80 SIR REPLIED THE BOY IF YOU HAVE TRAVELED VERY MUCH YOU WILL HAVE NOTICED THAT EVERY TOWN DIFFERS FROM EVERY OTHER TOWN IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER AND SO BY OBSERVING THE METHODS OF THE PEOPLE AND THE WAY THEY LIVE AS WELL AS THE STYLE OF THEIR DWELLING PLACES IT OUGHT NOT TO BE A DIFFICULT THING TO MAKE UP YOUR MIND WITHOUT THE TROUBLE OF ASKING QUESTIONS WHETHER THE TOWN BEARS THE APPEARANCE OF THE ONE YOU INTENDED TO VISIT OR WHETHER PERHAPS HAVING TAKEN A DIFFERENT ROAD FROM THE ONE YOU SHOULD HAVE TAKEN YOU HAVE MADE AN ERROR IN YOUR WAY AND ARRIVED AT SOME POINT WHERE LAND SAKES!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-81 CRIED AUNT EM IMPATIENTLY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-82 WHAT'S ALL THIS RIGMAROLE ABOUT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-83 THAT'S IT!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-84 SAID THE WIZARD LAUGHING MERRILY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-85 IT'S A RIGMAROLE BECAUSE THE BOY IS A RIGMAROLE AND WE'VE COME TO RIGMAROLE TOWN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-86 DO THEY ALL TALK LIKE THAT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-87 ASKED DOROTHY WONDERINGLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-88 HE MIGHT HAVE SAID YES OR NO AND SETTLED THE QUESTION OBSERVED UNCLE HENRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-89 NOT HERE SAID OMBY AMBY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-90 I DON'T BELIEVE THE RIGMAROLES KNOW WHAT YES OR NO MEANS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-91 WHILE THE BOY HAD BEEN TALKING SEVERAL OTHER PEOPLE HAD APPROACHED THE WAGON AND LISTENED INTENTLY TO HIS SPEECH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-92 THEN THEY BEGAN TALKING TO ONE ANOTHER IN LONG DELIBERATE SPEECHES WHERE MANY WORDS WERE USED BUT LITTLE WAS SAID.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-93 BUT WHEN THE STRANGERS CRITICIZED THEM SO FRANKLY ONE OF THE WOMEN WHO HAD NO ONE ELSE TO TALK TO BEGAN AN ADDRESS TO THEM SAYING, IT IS THE EASIEST THING IN THE WORLD FOR A PERSON TO SAY YES OR NO WHEN A QUESTION THAT IS ASKED FOR THE PURPOSE OF GAINING INFORMATION OR SATISFYING THE CURIOSITY OF THE ONE WHO HAS GIVEN EXPRESSION TO THE INQUIRY HAS ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF AN INDIVIDUAL WHO MAY BE COMPETENT EITHER FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE OR THE EXPERIENCE OF OTHERS TO ANSWER IT WITH MORE OR LESS CORRECTNESS OR AT LEAST AN ATTEMPT TO SATISFY THE DESIRE FOR INFORMATION ON THE PART OF THE ONE WHO HAS MADE THE INQUIRY BY DEAR ME!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-94 EXCLAIMED DOROTHY INTERRUPTING THE SPEECH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-95 I'VE LOST ALL TRACK OF WHAT YOU ARE SAYING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-96 DON'T LET HER BEGIN OVER AGAIN FOR GOODNESS SAKE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-97 CRIED AUNT EM. BUT THE WOMAN DID NOT BEGIN AGAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-98 SHE DID NOT EVEN STOP TALKING BUT WENT RIGHT ON AS SHE HAD BEGUN THE WORDS FLOWING FROM HER MOUTH IN A STREAM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-99 I'M QUITE SURE THAT IF WE WAITED LONG ENOUGH AND LISTENED CAREFULLY SOME OF THESE PEOPLE MIGHT BE ABLE TO TELL US SOMETHING IN TIME SAID THE WIZARD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-100 LET'S DON'T WAIT RETURNED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-101 I'VE HEARD OF THE RIGMAROLES AND WONDERED WHAT THEY WERE LIKE,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-102 BUT NOW I KNOW AND I'M READY TO MOVE ON.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-103 SO AM I DECLARED UNCLE HENRY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-104 WE'RE WASTING TIME HERE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-105 WHY WE'RE ALL READY TO GO SAID THE SHAGGY MAN PUTTING HIS FINGERS TO HIS EARS TO SHUT OUT THE MONOTONOUS BABBLE OF THOSE AROUND THE WAGON.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-106 SO THE WIZARD SPOKE TO THE SAWHORSE WHO TROTTED NIMBLY THROUGH THE VILLAGE AND SOON GAINED THE OPEN COUNTRY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-107 DOROTHY LOOKED BACK AS THEY RODE AWAY AND NOTICED THAT THE WOMAN HAD NOT YET FINISHED HER SPEECH BUT WAS TALKING AS GLIBLY AS EVER ALTHOUGH NO ONE WAS NEAR TO HEAR HER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-108 IF THOSE PEOPLE WROTE BOOKS OMBY AMBY REMARKED WITH A SMILE IT WOULD TAKE A WHOLE LIBRARY TO SAY THE COW JUMPED OVER THE MOON.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-109 PERHAPS SOME OF EM DO WRITE BOOKS ASSERTED THE LITTLE WIZARD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-110 I'VE READ A FEW RIGMAROLES THAT MIGHT HAVE COME FROM THIS VERY TOWN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-111 SOME OF THE COLLEGE LECTURERS AND MINISTERS ARE CERTAINLY RELATED TO THESE PEOPLE OBSERVED THE SHAGGY MAN,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-112 AND IT SEEMS TO ME THE LAND OF OZ IS A LITTLE AHEAD OF THE UNITED STATES IN SOME OF ITS LAWS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-113 FOR HERE IF ONE CAN'T TALK CLEARLY AND STRAIGHT TO THE POINT THEY SEND HIM TO RIGMAROLE TOWN,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-114 WHILE UNCLE SAM LETS HIM ROAM AROUND WILD AND FREE TO TORTURE INNOCENT PEOPLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-115 DOROTHY WAS THOUGHTFUL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-116 THE RIGMAROLES HAD MADE A STRONG IMPRESSION UPON HER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-22-117 SHE DECIDED THAT WHENEVER SHE SPOKE AFTER THIS SHE WOULD USE ONLY ENOUGH WORDS TO EXPRESS WHAT SHE WANTED TO SAY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-01 CHAPTER TWENTY THREE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-02 HOW THEY ENCOUNTERED THE FLUTTERBUDGETS THEY WERE SOON AMONG THE PRETTY HILLS AND VALLEYS AGAIN AND THE SAWHORSE SPED UP HILL AND DOWN AT A FAST AND EASY PACE THE ROADS BEING HARD AND SMOOTH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-03 MILE AFTER MILE WAS SPEEDILY COVERED AND BEFORE THE RIDE HAD GROWN AT ALL TIRESOME THEY SIGHTED ANOTHER VILLAGE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-04 THE PLACE SEEMED EVEN LARGER THAN RIGMAROLE TOWN BUT WAS NOT SO ATTRACTIVE IN APPEARANCE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-05 THIS MUST BE FLUTTERBUDGET CENTER DECLARED THE WIZARD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-06 YOU SEE IT'S NO TROUBLE AT ALL TO FIND PLACES IF YOU KEEP TO THE RIGHT ROAD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-07 WHAT ARE THE FLUTTERBUDGETS LIKE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-08 INQUIRED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-09 I DO NOT KNOW MY DEAR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-10 BUT OZMA HAS GIVEN THEM A TOWN ALL THEIR OWN AND I'VE HEARD THAT WHENEVER ONE OF THE PEOPLE BECOMES A FLUTTERBUDGET HE IS SENT TO THIS PLACE TO LIVE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-11 THAT IS TRUE OMBY AMBY ADDED,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-12 FLUTTERBUDGET CENTER AND RIGMAROLE TOWN ARE CALLED THE DEFENSIVE SETTLEMENTS OF OZ. THE VILLAGE THEY NOW APPROACHED WAS NOT BUILT IN A VALLEY BUT ON TOP OF A HILL AND THE ROAD THEY FOLLOWED WOUND AROUND THE HILL LIKE A CORKSCREW ASCENDING THE HILL EASILY UNTIL IT CAME TO THE TOWN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-13 LOOK OUT!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-14 SCREAMED A VOICE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-15 LOOK OUT OR YOU'LL RUN OVER MY CHILD!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-16 THEY GAZED AROUND AND SAW A WOMAN STANDING UPON THE SIDEWALK NERVOUSLY WRINGING HER HANDS AS SHE GAZED AT THEM APPEALINGLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-17 WHERE IS YOUR CHILD?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-18 ASKED THE SAWHORSE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-19 IN THE HOUSE SAID THE WOMAN BURSTING INTO TEARS,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-20 BUT IF IT SHOULD HAPPEN TO BE IN THE ROAD AND YOU RAN OVER IT THOSE GREAT WHEELS WOULD CRUSH MY DARLING TO JELLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-21 OH DEAR!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-22 OH DEAR!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-23 THINK OF MY DARLING CHILD BEING CRUSHED INTO JELLY BY THOSE GREAT WHEELS!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-24 SAID THE WIZARD SHARPLY AND THE SAWHORSE STARTED ON.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-25 THEY HAD NOT GONE FAR BEFORE A MAN RAN OUT OF A HOUSE SHOUTING WILDLY HELP!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-26 HELP!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-27 THE SAWHORSE STOPPED SHORT AND THE WIZARD AND UNCLE HENRY AND THE SHAGGY MAN AND OMBY AMBY JUMPED OUT OF THE WAGON AND RAN TO THE POOR MAN'S ASSISTANCE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-28 DOROTHY FOLLOWED THEM AS QUICKLY AS SHE COULD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-29 WHAT'S THE MATTER?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-30 ASKED THE WIZARD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-31 HELP!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-32 HELP!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-33 SCREAMED THE MAN,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-34 MY WIFE HAS CUT HER FINGER OFF AND SHE'S BLEEDING TO DEATH!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-35 THEN HE TURNED AND RUSHED BACK TO THE HOUSE AND ALL THE PARTY WENT WITH HIM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-36 THEY FOUND A WOMAN IN THE FRONT DOORYARD MOANING AND GROANING AS IF IN GREAT PAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-37 BE BRAVE MADAM!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-38 SAID THE WIZARD CONSOLINGLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-39 YOU WON'T DIE JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE CUT OFF A FINGER YOU MAY BE SURE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-40 BUT I HAVEN'T CUT OFF A FINGER!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-41 SHE SOBBED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-42 THEN WHAT HAS HAPPENED?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-43 ASKED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-44 I PRICKED MY FINGER WITH A NEEDLE WHILE I WAS SEWING AND AND THE BLOOD CAME!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-45 SHE REPLIED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-46 AND NOW I'LL HAVE BLOOD POISONING AND THE DOCTORS WILL CUT OFF MY FINGER AND THAT WILL GIVE ME A FEVER AND I SHALL DIE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-47 PSHAW!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-48 SAID DOROTHY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-49 I'VE PRICKED MY FINGER MANY A TIME AND NOTHING HAPPENED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-50 REALLY?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-51 ASKED THE WOMAN BRIGHTENING AND WIPING HER EYES UPON HER APRON.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-52 WHY IT'S NOTHING AT ALL DECLARED THE GIRL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-53 YOU'RE MORE SCARED THAN HURT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-54 AH THAT'S BECAUSE SHE'S A FLUTTERBUDGET SAID THE WIZARD NODDING WISELY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-55 I THINK I KNOW NOW WHAT THESE PEOPLE ARE LIKE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-56 SO DO I ANNOUNCED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-57 SOBBED THE WOMAN GIVING WAY TO A FRESH BURST OF GRIEF.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-58 WHAT'S WRONG NOW?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-59 ASKED THE SHAGGY MAN. OH SUPPOSE I HAD PRICKED MY FOOT!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-60 SHE WAILED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-61 THEN THE DOCTORS WOULD HAVE CUT MY FOOT OFF AND I'D BE LAMED FOR LIFE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-62 SURELY MA'AM REPLIED THE WIZARD AND IF YOU'D PRICKED YOUR NOSE THEY MIGHT CUT YOUR HEAD OFF.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-63 BUT YOU SEE YOU DIDN'T.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-64 BUT I MIGHT HAVE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-65 SHE EXCLAIMED AND BEGAN TO CRY AGAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-66 SO THEY LEFT HER AND DROVE AWAY IN THEIR WAGON.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-67 AND HER HUSBAND CAME OUT AND BEGAN CALLING HELP!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-68 AS HE HAD BEFORE,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-69 BUT NO ONE SEEMED TO PAY ANY ATTENTION TO HIM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-70 AS THE TRAVELERS TURNED INTO ANOTHER STREET THEY FOUND A MAN WALKING EXCITEDLY UP AND DOWN THE PAVEMENT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-71 HE APPEARED TO BE IN A VERY NERVOUS CONDITION AND THE WIZARD STOPPED HIM TO ASK, IS ANYTHING WRONG SIR?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-72 EVERYTHING IS WRONG ANSWERED THE MAN DISMALLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-73 I CAN'T SLEEP.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-74 WHY NOT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-75 INQUIRED OMBY AMBY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-76 IF I GO TO SLEEP I'LL HAVE TO SHUT MY EYES HE EXPLAINED,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-77 AND IF I SHUT MY EYES THEY MAY GROW TOGETHER AND THEN I'D BE BLIND FOR LIFE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-78 DID YOU EVER HEAR OF ANY ONE'S EYES GROWING TOGETHER?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-79 ASKED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-80 NO SAID THE MAN I NEVER DID.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-81 BUT IT WOULD BE A DREADFUL THING WOULDN'T IT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-82 AND THE THOUGHT OF IT MAKES ME SO NERVOUS I'M AFRAID TO GO TO SLEEP.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-83 THERE'S NO HELP FOR THIS CASE DECLARED THE WIZARD,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-84 AND THEY WENT ON.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-85 AT THE NEXT STREET CORNER A WOMAN RUSHED UP TO THEM CRYING, SAVE MY BABY!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-86 OH GOOD KIND PEOPLE SAVE MY BABY!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-87 IS IT IN DANGER?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-88 ASKED DOROTHY NOTICING THAT THE CHILD WAS CLASPED IN HER ARMS AND SEEMED SLEEPING PEACEFULLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-89 YES INDEED SAID THE WOMAN NERVOUSLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-90 IF I SHOULD GO INTO THE HOUSE AND THROW MY CHILD OUT OF THE WINDOW IT WOULD ROLL WAY DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF THE HILL,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-91 AND THEN IF THERE WERE A LOT OF TIGERS AND BEARS DOWN THERE THEY WOULD TEAR MY DARLING BABE TO PIECES AND EAT IT UP!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-92 ARE THERE ANY TIGERS AND BEARS IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-93 THE WIZARD ASKED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-94 I'VE NEVER HEARD OF ANY ADMITTED THE WOMAN BUT IF THERE WERE HAVE YOU ANY IDEA OF THROWING YOUR BABY OUT OF THE WINDOW?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-95 QUESTIONED THE LITTLE MAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-96 NONE AT ALL SHE SAID,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-97 BUT IF ALL YOUR TROUBLES ARE DUE TO THOSE IFS' DECLARED THE WIZARD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-98 IF YOU WERE NOT A FLUTTERBUDGET YOU WOULDN'T WORRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-99 THERE'S ANOTHER IF' REPLIED THE WOMAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-100 ARE YOU A FLUTTERBUDGET TOO?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-101 I WILL BE IF I STAY HERE LONG EXCLAIMED THE WIZARD NERVOUSLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-102 ANOTHER IF'!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-103 CRIED THE WOMAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-104 BUT THE WIZARD DID NOT STOP TO ARGUE WITH HER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-105 HE MADE THE SAWHORSE CANTER ALL THE WAY DOWN THE HILL AND ONLY BREATHED EASILY WHEN THEY WERE MILES AWAY FROM THE VILLAGE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-106 AFTER THEY HAD RIDDEN IN SILENCE FOR A WHILE DOROTHY TURNED TO THE LITTLE MAN AND ASKED, DO IFS REALLY MAKE FLUTTERBUDGETS?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-107 I THINK THE IFS HELP HE ANSWERED SERIOUSLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-108 FOOLISH FEARS AND WORRIES OVER NOTHING WITH A MIXTURE OF NERVES AND IFS WILL SOON MAKE A FLUTTERBUDGET OF ANY ONE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-109 THEN THERE WAS ANOTHER LONG SILENCE FOR ALL THE TRAVELERS WERE THINKING OVER THIS STATEMENT AND NEARLY ALL DECIDED IT MUST BE TRUE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-110 THE COUNTRY THEY WERE NOW PASSING THROUGH WAS EVERYWHERE TINTED PURPLE THE PREVAILING COLOR OF THE GILLIKIN COUNTRY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-111 BUT AS THE SAWHORSE ASCENDED A HILL THEY FOUND THAT UPON THE OTHER SIDE EVERYTHING WAS OF A RICH YELLOW HUE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-112 AHA!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-113 CRIED THE CAPTAIN GENERAL,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-114 HERE IS THE COUNTRY OF THE WINKIES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-115 WE ARE JUST CROSSING THE BOUNDARY LINE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-116 THEN WE MAY BE ABLE TO LUNCH WITH THE TIN WOODMAN ANNOUNCED THE WIZARD JOYFULLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-117 MUST WE LUNCH ON TIN?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-118 ASKED AUNT EM. OH NO,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-119 REPLIED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-120 NICK CHOPPER KNOWS HOW TO FEED MEAT PEOPLE AND HE WILL GIVE US PLENTY OF GOOD THINGS TO EAT NEVER FEAR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-121 I'VE BEEN TO HIS CASTLE BEFORE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-122 IS NICK CHOPPER THE TIN WOODMAN'S NAME?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-123 ASKED UNCLE HENRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-124 YES,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-125 THAT'S ONE OF HIS NAMES ANSWERED THE LITTLE GIRL,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-126 AND ANOTHER OF HIS NAMES IS EMP'ROR OF THE WINKIES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-127 HE'S THE KING OF THIS COUNTRY YOU KNOW BUT OZMA RULES OVER ALL THE COUNTRIES OF OZ. DOES THE TIN WOODMAN KEEP ANY FLUTTERBUDGETS OR RIGMAROLES AT HIS CASTLE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-128 UNEASILY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-129 NO INDEED SAID DOROTHY POSITIVELY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-130 HE LIVES IN A NEW TIN CASTLE ALL FULL OF LOVELY THINGS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-131 I SHOULD THINK IT WOULD RUST SAID UNCLE HENRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-132 HE HAS THOUSANDS OF WINKIES TO KEEP IT POLISHED FOR HIM EXPLAINED THE WIZARD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-133 HIS PEOPLE LOVE TO DO ANYTHING IN THEIR POWER FOR THEIR BELOVED EMPEROR SO THERE ISN'T A PARTICLE OF RUST ON ALL THE BIG CASTLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-134 I SUPPOSE THEY POLISH THEIR EMPEROR TOO SAID AUNT EM. WHY SOME TIME AGO HE HAD HIMSELF NICKEL PLATED THE WIZARD ANSWERED,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-135 SO HE ONLY NEEDS RUBBING UP ONCE IN A WHILE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-136 HE'S THE BRIGHTEST MAN IN ALL THE WORLD IS DEAR NICK CHOPPER,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-137 AND THE KINDEST HEARTED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-138 I HELPED FIND HIM SAID DOROTHY REFLECTIVELY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-139 ONCE THE SCARECROW AND I FOUND THE TIN WOODMAN IN THE WOODS AND HE WAS JUST RUSTED STILL THAT TIME AN NO MISTAKE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-140 BUT WE OILED HIS JOINTS AN GOT EM GOOD AND SLIPPERY AND AFTER THAT HE WENT WITH US TO VISIT THE WIZARD AT THE EM'RALD CITY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-141 WAS THAT THE TIME THE WIZARD SCARED YOU?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-142 ASKED AUNT EM. HE DIDN'T TREAT US WELL AT FIRST ACKNOWLEDGED DOROTHY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-143 FOR HE MADE US GO AWAY AND DESTROY THE WICKED WITCH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-144 BUT AFTER WE FOUND OUT HE WAS ONLY A HUMBUG WIZARD WE WERE NOT AFRAID OF HIM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-145 THE WIZARD SIGHED AND LOOKED A LITTLE ASHAMED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-146 WHEN WE TRY TO DECEIVE PEOPLE WE ALWAYS MAKE MISTAKES HE SAID.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-147 BUT I'M GETTING TO BE A REAL WIZARD NOW AND GLINDA THE GOOD'S MAGIC THAT I AM TRYING TO PRACTICE CAN NEVER HARM ANY ONE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-148 YOU WERE ALWAYS A GOOD MAN DECLARED DOROTHY EVEN WHEN YOU WERE A BAD WIZARD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-149 HE'S A GOOD WIZARD NOW ASSERTED AUNT EM LOOKING AT THE LITTLE MAN ADMIRINGLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-150 THE WAY HE MADE THOSE TENTS GROW OUT OF HANDKERCHIEFS WAS JUST WONDERFUL!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-151 AND DIDN'T HE ENCHANT THE WAGON WHEELS SO THEY'D FIND THE ROAD?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-152 ALL THE PEOPLE OF OZ SAID THE CAPTAIN GENERAL ARE VERY PROUD OF THEIR WIZARD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-153 HE ONCE MADE SOME SOAP BUBBLES THAT ASTONISHED THE WORLD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-154 THE WIZARD BLUSHED AT THIS PRAISE YET IT PLEASED HIM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-155 HE NO LONGER LOOKED SAD BUT SEEMED TO HAVE RECOVERED HIS USUAL GOOD HUMOR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-156 THE COUNTRY THROUGH WHICH THEY NOW RODE WAS THICKLY DOTTED WITH FARMHOUSES AND YELLOW GRAIN WAVED IN ALL THE FIELDS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-157 MANY OF THE WINKIES COULD BE SEEN WORKING ON THEIR FARMS AND THE WILD AND UNSETTLED PARTS OF OZ WERE BY THIS TIME LEFT FAR BEHIND.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-158 THESE WINKIES APPEARED TO BE HAPPY LIGHT HEARTED FOLK AND ALL REMOVED THEIR CAPS AND BOWED LOW WHEN THE RED WAGON WITH ITS LOAD OF TRAVELERS PASSED BY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-159 IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE THEY SAW SOMETHING GLITTERING IN THE SUNSHINE FAR AHEAD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-160 SEE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-161 CRIED DOROTHY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-162 THAT'S THE TIN CASTLE AUNT EM!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-23-163 AND THE SAWHORSE KNOWING HIS PASSENGERS WERE EAGER TO ARRIVE BROKE INTO A SWIFT TROT THAT SOON BROUGHT THEM TO THEIR DESTINATION.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-01 CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-02 HOW THE TIN WOODMAN TOLD THE SAD NEWS THE TIN WOODMAN RECEIVED PRINCESS DOROTHY'S PARTY WITH MUCH GRACE AND CORDIALITY YET THE LITTLE GIRL DECIDED THAT SOMETHING MUST BE WORRYING WITH HER OLD FRIEND BECAUSE HE WAS NOT SO MERRY AS USUAL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-03 BUT AT FIRST SHE SAID NOTHING ABOUT THIS FOR UNCLE HENRY AND AUNT EM WERE FAIRLY BUBBLING OVER WITH ADMIRATION FOR THE BEAUTIFUL TIN CASTLE AND ITS POLISHED TIN OWNER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-04 SO HER SUSPICION THAT SOMETHING UNPLEASANT HAD HAPPENED WAS FOR A TIME FORGOTTEN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-05 WHERE IS THE SCARECROW?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-06 SHE ASKED WHEN THEY HAD ALL BEEN USHERED INTO THE BIG TIN DRAWING ROOM OF THE CASTLE THE SAWHORSE BEING LED AROUND TO THE TIN STABLE IN THE REAR.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-07 WHY OUR OLD FRIEND HAS JUST MOVED INTO HIS NEW MANSION EXPLAINED THE TIN WOODMAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-08 IT HAS BEEN A LONG TIME IN BUILDING ALTHOUGH MY WINKIES AND MANY OTHER PEOPLE FROM ALL PARTS OF THE COUNTRY HAVE BEEN BUSILY WORKING UPON IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-09 AT LAST HOWEVER IT IS COMPLETED AND THE SCARECROW TOOK POSSESSION OF HIS NEW HOME JUST TWO DAYS AGO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-10 I HADN'T HEARD THAT HE WANTED A HOME OF HIS OWN SAID DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-11 WHY DOESN'T HE LIVE WITH OZMA IN THE EMERALD CITY?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-12 HE USED TO YOU KNOW,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-13 AND I THOUGHT HE WAS HAPPY THERE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-14 IT SEEMS SAID THE TIN WOODMAN THAT OUR DEAR SCARECROW CANNOT BE CONTENTED WITH CITY LIFE HOWEVER BEAUTIFUL HIS SURROUNDINGS MIGHT BE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-15 ORIGINALLY HE WAS A FARMER FOR HE PASSED HIS EARLY LIFE IN A CORNFIELD WHERE HE WAS SUPPOSED TO FRIGHTEN AWAY THE CROWS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-16 I KNOW SAID DOROTHY NODDING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-17 I FOUND HIM AND LIFTED HIM DOWN FROM HIS POLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-18 SO NOW AFTER A LONG RESIDENCE IN THE EMERALD CITY HIS TASTES HAVE TURNED TO FARM LIFE AGAIN CONTINUED THE TIN MAN. HE FEELS THAT HE CANNOT BE HAPPY WITHOUT A FARM OF HIS OWN SO OZMA GAVE HIM SOME LAND AND EVERY ONE HELPED HIM BUILD HIS MANSION AND NOW HE IS SETTLED THERE FOR GOOD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-19 WHO DESIGNED HIS HOUSE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-20 ASKED THE SHAGGY MAN. I BELIEVE IT WAS JACK PUMPKINHEAD WHO IS ALSO A FARMER WAS THE REPLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-21 THEY WERE NOW INVITED TO ENTER THE TIN DINING ROOM WHERE LUNCHEON WAS SERVED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-22 AUNT EM FOUND TO HER SATISFACTION THAT DOROTHY'S PROMISE WAS MORE THAN FULFILLED,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-23 FOR ALTHOUGH THE TIN WOODMAN HAD NO APPETITE OF HIS OWN HE RESPECTED THE APPETITES OF HIS GUESTS AND SAW THAT THEY WERE BOUNTIFULLY FED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-24 THEY PASSED THE AFTERNOON IN WANDERING THROUGH THE BEAUTIFUL GARDENS AND GROUNDS OF THE PALACE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-25 THE WALKS WERE ALL PAVED WITH SHEETS OF TIN BRIGHTLY POLISHED AND THERE WERE TIN FOUNTAINS AND TIN STATUES HERE AND THERE AMONG THE TREES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-26 THE FLOWERS WERE MOSTLY NATURAL FLOWERS AND GREW IN THE REGULAR WAY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-27 BUT THEIR HOST SHOWED THEM ONE FLOWER BED WHICH WAS HIS ESPECIAL PRIDE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-28 YOU SEE ALL COMMON FLOWERS FADE AND DIE IN TIME HE EXPLAINED AND SO THERE ARE SEASONS WHEN THE PRETTY BLOOMS ARE SCARCE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-29 THEREFORE I DECIDED TO MAKE ONE TIN FLOWER BED ALL OF TIN FLOWERS AND MY WORKMEN HAVE CREATED THEM WITH RARE SKILL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-30 HERE YOU SEE TIN CAMELIAS TIN MARIGOLDS TIN CARNATIONS TIN POPPIES AND TIN HOLLYHOCKS GROWING AS NATURALLY AS IF THEY WERE REAL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-31 INDEED THEY WERE A PRETTY SIGHT AND GLISTENED UNDER THE SUNLIGHT LIKE SPUN SILVER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-32 ISN'T THIS TIN HOLLYHOCK GOING TO SEED?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-33 ASKED THE WIZARD BENDING OVER THE FLOWERS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-34 WHY I BELIEVE IT IS!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-35 EXCLAIMED THE TIN WOODMAN AS IF SURPRISED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-36 I HADN'T NOTICED THAT BEFORE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-37 BUT I SHALL PLANT THE TIN SEEDS AND RAISE ANOTHER BED OF TIN HOLLYHOCKS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-38 IN ONE CORNER OF THE GARDENS NICK CHOPPER HAD ESTABLISHED A FISH POND IN WHICH THEY SAW SWIMMING AND DISPORTING THEMSELVES MANY PRETTY TIN FISHES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-39 WOULD THEY BITE ON HOOKS?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-40 ASKED AUNT EM CURIOUSLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-41 THE TIN WOODMAN SEEMED HURT AT THIS QUESTION.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-42 MADAM SAID HE DO YOU SUPPOSE I WOULD ALLOW ANYONE TO CATCH MY BEAUTIFUL FISHES EVEN IF THEY WERE FOOLISH ENOUGH TO BITE ON HOOKS?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-43 NO INDEED!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-44 EVERY CREATED THING IS SAFE FROM HARM IN MY DOMAIN AND I WOULD AS SOON THINK OF KILLING MY LITTLE FRIEND DOROTHY AS KILLING ONE OF MY TIN FISHES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-45 THE EMPEROR IS VERY KIND HEARTED MA'AM EXPLAINED THE WIZARD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-46 IF A FLY HAPPENS TO LIGHT UPON HIS TIN BODY HE DOESN'T RUDELY BRUSH IT OFF AS SOME PEOPLE MIGHT DO,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-47 HE ASKS IT POLITELY TO FIND SOME OTHER RESTING PLACE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-48 WHAT DOES THE FLY DO THEN?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-49 ENQUIRED AUNT EM. USUALLY IT BEGS HIS PARDON AND GOES AWAY SAID THE WIZARD GRAVELY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-50 FLIES LIKE TO BE TREATED POLITELY AS WELL AS OTHER CREATURES AND HERE IN OZ THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT WE SAY TO THEM AND BEHAVE VERY NICELY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-51 WELL SAID AUNT EM THE FLIES IN KANSAS WHERE I CAME FROM DON'T UNDERSTAND ANYTHING BUT A SWAT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-52 YOU HAVE TO SMASH EM TO MAKE EM BEHAVE,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-53 AND IT'S THE SAME WAY WITH SKEETERS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-54 DO YOU HAVE SKEETERS IN OZ?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-55 WE HAVE SOME VERY LARGE MOSQUITOES HERE WHICH SING AS BEAUTIFULLY AS SONG BIRDS REPLIED THE TIN WOODMAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-56 BUT THEY NEVER BITE OR ANNOY OUR PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY ARE WELL FED AND TAKEN CARE OF.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-57 THE REASON THEY BITE PEOPLE IN YOUR COUNTRY IS BECAUSE THEY ARE HUNGRY POOR THINGS!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-58 YES AGREED AUNT EM,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-59 THEY'RE HUNGRY ALL RIGHT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-60 AN THEY AIN'T VERY PARTICULAR WHO THEY FEED ON.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-61 I'M GLAD YOU'VE GOT THE SKEETERS EDUCATED IN OZ. THAT EVENING AFTER DINNER THEY WERE ENTERTAINED BY THE EMPEROR'S TIN CORNET BAND WHICH PLAYED FOR THEM SEVERAL SWEET MELODIES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-62 ALSO THE WIZARD DID A FEW SLEIGHT OF HAND TRICKS TO AMUSE THE COMPANY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-63 AFTER WHICH THEY ALL RETIRED TO THEIR COZY TIN BEDROOMS AND SLEPT SOUNDLY UNTIL MORNING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-64 AFTER BREAKFAST DOROTHY SAID TO THE TIN WOODMAN, IF YOU'LL TELL US WHICH WAY TO GO WE'LL VISIT THE SCARECROW ON OUR WAY HOME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-65 I WILL GO WITH YOU AND SHOW YOU THE WAY REPLIED THE EMPEROR,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-66 FOR I MUST JOURNEY TO DAY TO THE EMERALD CITY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-67 HE LOOKED SO ANXIOUS AS HE SAID THIS THAT THE LITTLE GIRL ASKED, THERE ISN'T ANYTHING WRONG WITH OZMA IS THERE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-68 NOT YET SAID HE,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-69 BUT I'M AFRAID THE TIME HAS COME WHEN I MUST TELL YOU SOME VERY BAD NEWS LITTLE FRIEND.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-70 OH WHAT IS IT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-71 CRIED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-72 DO YOU REMEMBER THE NOME KING?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-73 ASKED THE TIN WOODMAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-74 I REMEMBER HIM VERY WELL SHE REPLIED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-75 THE NOME KING HAS NOT A KIND HEART SAID THE EMPEROR SADLY AND HE HAS BEEN HARBORING WICKED THOUGHTS OF REVENGE BECAUSE WE ONCE DEFEATED HIM AND LIBERATED HIS SLAVES AND YOU TOOK AWAY HIS MAGIC BELT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-76 SO HE HAS ORDERED HIS NOMES TO DIG A LONG TUNNEL UNDERNEATH THE DEADLY DESERT SO THAT HE MAY MARCH HIS HOSTS RIGHT INTO THE EMERALD CITY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-77 WHEN HE GETS THERE HE INTENDS TO DESTROY OUR BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-78 DOROTHY WAS MUCH SURPRISED TO HEAR THIS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-79 HOW DID OZMA FIND OUT ABOUT THE TUNNEL?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-80 SHE ASKED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-81 SHE SAW IT IN HER MAGIC PICTURE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-82 OF COURSE SAID DOROTHY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-83 I MIGHT HAVE KNOWN THAT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-84 AND WHAT IS SHE GOING TO DO?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-85 I CANNOT TELL WAS THE REPLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-86 POOH!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-87 CRIED THE YELLOW HEN. WE'RE NOT AFRAID OF THE NOMES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-88 IF WE ROLL A FEW OF OUR EGGS DOWN THE TUNNEL THEY'LL RUN AWAY BACK HOME AS FAST AS THEY CAN GO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-89 WHY THAT'S TRUE ENOUGH!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-90 EXCLAIMED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-91 THE SCARECROW ONCE CONQUERED ALL THE NOME KING'S ARMY WITH SOME OF BILLINA'S EGGS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-92 BUT YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND ALL OF THE DREADFUL PLOT CONTINUED THE TIN WOODMAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-93 THE NOME KING IS CLEVER AND HE KNOWS HIS NOMES WOULD RUN FROM EGGS,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-94 SO HE HAS BARGAINED WITH MANY TERRIBLE CREATURES TO HELP HIM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-95 THESE EVIL SPIRITS ARE NOT AFRAID OF EGGS OR ANYTHING ELSE AND THEY ARE VERY POWERFUL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-96 SO THE NOME KING WILL SEND THEM THROUGH THE TUNNEL FIRST TO CONQUER AND DESTROY AND THEN THE NOMES WILL FOLLOW AFTER TO GET THEIR SHARE OF THE PLUNDER AND SLAVES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-97 THEY WERE ALL STARTLED TO HEAR THIS AND EVERY FACE WORE A TROUBLED LOOK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-98 IS THE TUNNEL ALL READY?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-99 ASKED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-100 OZMA SENT ME WORD YESTERDAY THAT THE TUNNEL WAS ALL COMPLETED EXCEPT FOR A THIN CRUST OF EARTH AT THE END.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-101 WHEN OUR ENEMIES BREAK THROUGH THIS CRUST THEY WILL BE IN THE GARDENS OF THE ROYAL PALACE IN THE HEART OF THE EMERALD CITY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-102 I OFFERED TO ARM ALL MY WINKIES AND MARCH TO OZMA'S ASSISTANCE,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-103 BUT SHE SAID NO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-104 I WONDER WHY?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-105 ASKED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-106 SHE ANSWERED THAT ALL THE INHABITANTS OF OZ GATHERED TOGETHER WERE NOT POWERFUL ENOUGH TO FIGHT AND OVERCOME THE EVIL FORCES OF THE NOME KING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-107 THEREFORE SHE REFUSES TO FIGHT AT ALL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-108 BUT THEY WILL CAPTURE AND ENSLAVE US AND PLUNDER AND RUIN ALL OUR LOVELY LAND!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-109 EXCLAIMED THE WIZARD GREATLY DISTURBED BY THIS STATEMENT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-110 I FEAR THEY WILL SAID THE TIN WOODMAN SORROWFULLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-111 AND I ALSO FEAR THAT THOSE WHO ARE NOT FAIRIES SUCH AS THE WIZARD AND DOROTHY AND HER UNCLE AND AUNT AS WELL AS TOTO AND BILLINA WILL BE SPEEDILY PUT TO DEATH BY THE CONQUERORS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-112 WHAT CAN BE DONE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-113 ASKED DOROTHY SHUDDERING A LITTLE AT THE PROSPECT OF THIS AWFUL FATE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-114 NOTHING CAN BE DONE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-115 GLOOMILY REPLIED THE EMPEROR OF THE WINKIES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-116 BUT SINCE OZMA REFUSES MY ARMY I WILL GO MYSELF TO THE EMERALD CITY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-24-117 THE LEAST I MAY DO IS TO PERISH BESIDE MY BELOVED RULER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-01 CHAPTER TWENTY FIVE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-02 HOW THE SCARECROW DISPLAYED HIS WISDOM THIS AMAZING NEWS HAD SADDENED EVERY HEART AND ALL WERE NOW ANXIOUS TO RETURN TO THE EMERALD CITY AND SHARE OZMA'S FATE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-03 SO THEY STARTED WITHOUT LOSS OF TIME AND AS THE ROAD LED PAST THE SCARECROW'S NEW MANSION THEY DETERMINED TO MAKE A BRIEF HALT THERE AND CONFER WITH HIM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-04 THE SCARECROW IS PROBABLY THE WISEST MAN IN ALL OZ REMARKED THE TIN WOODMAN WHEN THEY HAD STARTED UPON THEIR JOURNEY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-05 HIS BRAINS ARE PLENTIFUL AND OF EXCELLENT QUALITY AND OFTEN HE HAS TOLD ME THINGS I MIGHT NEVER HAVE THOUGHT OF MYSELF.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-06 I MUST SAY I RELY A GREAT DEAL UPON THE SCARECROW'S BRAINS IN THIS EMERGENCY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-07 THE TIN WOODMAN RODE ON THE FRONT SEAT OF THE WAGON WHERE DOROTHY SAT BETWEEN HIM AND THE WIZARD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-08 HAS THE SCARECROW HEARD OF OZMA'S TROUBLE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-09 ASKED THE CAPTAIN GENERAL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-10 I DO NOT KNOW SIR WAS THE REPLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-11 WHEN I WAS A PRIVATE SAID OMBY AMBY I WAS AN EXCELLENT ARMY AS I FULLY PROVED IN OUR WAR AGAINST THE NOMES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-12 BUT NOW THERE IS NOT A SINGLE PRIVATE LEFT IN OUR ARMY SINCE OZMA MADE ME THE CAPTAIN GENERAL SO THERE IS NO ONE TO FIGHT AND DEFEND OUR LOVELY RULER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-13 TRUE SAID THE WIZARD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-14 THE PRESENT ARMY IS COMPOSED ONLY OF OFFICERS AND THE BUSINESS OF AN OFFICER IS TO ORDER HIS MEN TO FIGHT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-15 SINCE THERE ARE NO MEN THERE CAN BE NO FIGHTING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-16 POOR OZMA!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-17 WHISPERED DOROTHY WITH TEARS IN HER SWEET EYES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-18 IT'S DREADFUL TO THINK OF ALL HER LOVELY FAIRY COUNTRY BEING DESTROYED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-19 I WONDER IF WE COULDN'T MANAGE TO ESCAPE AND GET BACK TO KANSAS BY MEANS OF THE MAGIC BELT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-20 AND WE MIGHT TAKE OZMA WITH US AND ALL WORK HARD TO GET MONEY FOR HER SO SHE WOULDN'T BE SO VERY LONELY AND UNHAPPY ABOUT THE LOSS OF HER FAIRYLAND.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-21 DO YOU THINK THERE WOULD BE ANY WORK FOR ME IN KANSAS?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-22 ASKED THE TIN WOODMAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-23 IF YOU ARE HOLLOW THEY MIGHT USE YOU IN A CANNING FACTORY SUGGESTED UNCLE HENRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-24 BUT I CAN'T SEE THE USE OF YOUR WORKING FOR A LIVING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-25 YOU NEVER EAT OR SLEEP OR NEED A NEW SUIT OF CLOTHES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-26 I WAS NOT THINKING OF MYSELF REPLIED THE EMPEROR WITH DIGNITY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-27 I MERELY WONDERED IF I COULD NOT HELP TO SUPPORT DOROTHY AND OZMA.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-28 AS THEY INDULGED IN THESE SAD PLANS FOR THE FUTURE THEY JOURNEYED IN SIGHT OF THE SCARECROW'S NEW MANSION AND EVEN THOUGH FILLED WITH CARE AND WORRY OVER THE IMPENDING FATE OF OZ DOROTHY COULDN'T HELP A FEELING OF WONDER AT THE SIGHT SHE SAW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-29 THE SCARECROW'S NEW HOUSE WAS SHAPED LIKE AN IMMENSE EAR OF CORN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-30 THE ROWS OF KERNELS WERE MADE OF SOLID GOLD AND THE GREEN UPON WHICH THE EAR STOOD UPRIGHT WAS A MASS OF SPARKLING EMERALDS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-31 UPON THE VERY TOP OF THE STRUCTURE WAS PERCHED A FIGURE REPRESENTING THE SCARECROW HIMSELF AND UPON HIS EXTENDED ARMS AS WELL AS UPON HIS HEAD WERE SEVERAL CROWS CARVED OUT OF EBONY AND HAVING RUBY EYES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-32 YOU MAY IMAGINE HOW BIG THIS EAR OF CORN WAS WHEN I TELL YOU THAT A SINGLE GOLD KERNEL FORMED A WINDOW SWINGING OUTWARD UPON HINGES WHILE A ROW OF FOUR KERNELS OPENED TO MAKE THE FRONT ENTRANCE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-33 INSIDE THERE WERE FIVE STORIES EACH STORY BEING A SINGLE ROOM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-34 THE GARDENS AROUND THE MANSION CONSISTED OF CORNFIELDS AND DOROTHY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE PLACE WAS IN ALL RESPECTS A VERY APPROPRIATE HOME FOR HER GOOD FRIEND THE SCARECROW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-35 HE WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY HAPPY HERE I'M SURE SHE SAID IF ONLY THE NOME KING HAD LEFT US ALONE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-36 BUT IF OZ IS DESTROYED OF COURSE THIS PLACE WILL BE DESTROYED TOO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-37 YES REPLIED THE TIN WOODMAN AND ALSO MY BEAUTIFUL TIN CASTLE THAT HAS BEEN MY JOY AND PRIDE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-38 JACK PUMPKINHEAD'S HOUSE WILL GO TOO REMARKED THE WIZARD AS WELL AS PROFESSOR WOGGLEBUG'S ATHLETIC COLLEGE AND OZMA'S ROYAL PALACE AND ALL OUR OTHER HANDSOME BUILDINGS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-39 YES OZ WILL INDEED BECOME A DESERT WHEN THE NOME KING GETS THROUGH WITH IT SIGHED OMBY AMBY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-40 THE SCARECROW CAME OUT TO MEET THEM AND GAVE THEM ALL A HEARTY WELCOME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-41 I HEAR YOU HAVE DECIDED ALWAYS TO LIVE IN THE LAND OF OZ AFTER THIS HE SAID TO DOROTHY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-42 AND THAT WILL DELIGHT MY HEART FOR I HAVE GREATLY DISLIKED OUR FREQUENT PARTINGS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-43 BUT WHY ARE YOU ALL SO DOWNCAST?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-44 HAVE YOU HEARD THE NEWS?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-45 ASKED THE TIN WOODMAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-46 NO NEWS TO MAKE ME SAD REPLIED THE SCARECROW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-47 THEN NICK CHOPPER TOLD HIS FRIEND OF THE NOME KING'S TUNNEL AND HOW THE EVIL CREATURES OF THE NORTH HAD ALLIED THEMSELVES WITH THE UNDERGROUND MONARCH FOR THE PURPOSE OF CONQUERING AND DESTROYING OZ. WELL SAID THE SCARECROW IT CERTAINLY LOOKS BAD FOR OZMA AND ALL OF US.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-48 BUT I BELIEVE IT IS WRONG TO WORRY OVER ANYTHING BEFORE IT HAPPENS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-49 IT IS SURELY TIME ENOUGH TO BE SAD WHEN OUR COUNTRY IS DESPOILED AND OUR PEOPLE MADE SLAVES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-50 SO LET US NOT DEPRIVE OURSELVES OF THE FEW HAPPY HOURS REMAINING TO US.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-51 AH!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-52 THAT IS REAL WISDOM DECLARED THE SHAGGY MAN APPROVINGLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-53 AFTER WE BECOME REALLY UNHAPPY WE SHALL REGRET THESE FEW HOURS THAT ARE LEFT TO US UNLESS WE ENJOY THEM TO THE UTMOST.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-54 NEVERTHELESS SAID THE SCARECROW I SHALL GO WITH YOU TO THE EMERALD CITY AND OFFER OZMA MY SERVICES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-55 SHE SAYS WE CAN DO NOTHING TO OPPOSE OUR ENEMIES ANNOUNCED THE TIN WOODMAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-56 AND DOUBTLESS SHE IS RIGHT SIR ANSWERED THE SCARECROW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-57 STILL SHE WILL APPRECIATE OUR SYMPATHY AND IT IS THE DUTY OF OZMA'S FRIENDS TO STAND BY HER SIDE WHEN THE FINAL DISASTER OCCURS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-58 HE THEN LED THEM INTO HIS QUEER MANSION AND SHOWED THEM THE BEAUTIFUL ROOMS IN ALL THE FIVE STORIES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-59 THE LOWER ROOM WAS A GRAND RECEPTION HALL WITH A HAND ORGAN IN ONE CORNER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-60 THIS INSTRUMENT THE SCARECROW WHEN ALONE COULD TURN TO AMUSE HIMSELF AS HE WAS VERY FOND OF MUSIC.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-61 THE WALLS WERE HUNG WITH WHITE SILK UPON WHICH FLOCKS OF BLACK CROWS WERE EMBROIDERED IN BLACK DIAMONDS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-62 SOME OF THE CHAIRS WERE MADE IN THE SHAPE OF BIG CROWS AND UPHOLSTERED WITH CUSHIONS OF CORN COLORED SILK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-63 THE SECOND STORY CONTAINED A FINE BANQUET ROOM WHERE THE SCARECROW MIGHT ENTERTAIN HIS GUESTS AND THE THREE STORIES ABOVE THAT WERE BED CHAMBERS EXQUISITELY FURNISHED AND DECORATED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-64 FROM THESE ROOMS SAID THE SCARECROW PROUDLY ONE MAY OBTAIN FINE VIEWS OF THE SURROUNDING CORNFIELDS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-65 THE CORN I GROW IS ALWAYS HUSKY AND I CALL THE EARS MY REGIMENTS BECAUSE THEY HAVE SO MANY KERNELS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-66 OF COURSE I CANNOT RIDE MY COBS BUT I REALLY DON'T CARE SHUCKS ABOUT THAT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-67 TAKEN ALTOGETHER MY FARM WILL STACK UP WITH ANY IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-68 THE VISITORS PARTOOK OF SOME LIGHT REFRESHMENT AND THEN HURRIED AWAY TO RESUME THE ROAD TO THE EMERALD CITY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-69 THE SCARECROW FOUND A SEAT IN THE WAGON BETWEEN OMBY AMBY AND THE SHAGGY MAN AND HIS WEIGHT DID NOT ADD MUCH TO THE LOAD BECAUSE HE WAS STUFFED WITH STRAW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-70 YOU WILL NOTICE I HAVE ONE OAT FIELD ON MY PROPERTY HE REMARKED AS THEY DROVE AWAY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-71 OAT STRAW IS I HAVE FOUND THE BEST OF ALL STRAWS TO RE STUFF MYSELF WITH WHEN MY INTERIOR GETS MUSTY OR OUT OF SHAPE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-72 ARE YOU ABLE TO RE STUFF YOURSELF WITHOUT HELP?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-73 ASKED AUNT EM. I SHOULD THINK THAT AFTER THE STRAW WAS TAKEN OUT OF YOU THERE WOULDN'T BE ANYTHING LEFT BUT YOUR CLOTHES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-74 YOU ARE ALMOST CORRECT MADAM HE ANSWERED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-75 MY SERVANTS DO THE STUFFING UNDER MY DIRECTION.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-76 FOR MY HEAD IN WHICH ARE MY EXCELLENT BRAINS IS A BAG TIED AT THE BOTTOM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-77 MY FACE IS NEATLY PAINTED UPON ONE SIDE OF THE BAG AS YOU MAY SEE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-78 MY HEAD DOES NOT NEED RE STUFFING AS MY BODY DOES FOR ALL THAT IT REQUIRES IS TO HAVE THE FACE TOUCHED UP WITH FRESH PAINT OCCASIONALLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-79 IT WAS NOT FAR FROM THE SCARECROW'S MANSION TO THE FARM OF JACK PUMPKINHEAD AND WHEN THEY ARRIVED THERE BOTH UNCLE HENRY AND AUNT EM WERE MUCH IMPRESSED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-80 THE FARM WAS ONE VAST PUMPKIN FIELD AND SOME OF THE PUMPKINS WERE OF ENORMOUS SIZE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-81 IN ONE OF THEM WHICH HAD BEEN NEATLY HOLLOWED OUT JACK HIMSELF LIVED AND HE DECLARED THAT IT WAS A VERY COMFORTABLE RESIDENCE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-82 THE REASON HE GREW SO MANY PUMPKINS WAS IN ORDER THAT HE MIGHT CHANGE HIS HEAD AS OFTEN AS IT BECAME WRINKLED OR THREATENED TO SPOIL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-83 THE PUMPKIN HEADED MAN WELCOMED HIS VISITORS JOYFULLY AND OFFERED THEM SEVERAL DELICIOUS PUMPKIN PIES TO EAT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-84 I DON'T INDULGE IN PUMPKIN PIES MYSELF FOR TWO REASONS HE SAID.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-85 ONE REASON IS THAT WERE I TO EAT PUMPKINS I WOULD BECOME A CANNIBAL AND THE OTHER REASON IS THAT I NEVER EAT NOT BEING HOLLOW INSIDE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-86 VERY GOOD REASONS AGREED THE SCARECROW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-87 THEY TOLD JACK PUMPKINHEAD OF THE DREADFUL NEWS ABOUT THE NOME KING AND HE DECIDED TO GO WITH THEM TO THE EMERALD CITY AND HELP COMFORT OZMA.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-88 I HAD EXPECTED TO LIVE HERE IN EASE AND COMFORT FOR MANY CENTURIES SAID JACK DOLEFULLY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-89 BUT OF COURSE IF THE NOME KING DESTROYS EVERYTHING IN OZ I SHALL BE DESTROYED TOO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-90 REALLY IT SEEMS TOO BAD DOESN'T IT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-25-91 THEY WERE SOON ON THEIR JOURNEY AGAIN AND SO SWIFTLY DID THE SAWHORSE DRAW THE WAGON OVER THE SMOOTH ROADS THAT BEFORE TWILIGHT FELL THEY HAD REACHED THE ROYAL PALACE IN THE EMERALD CITY AND WERE AT THEIR JOURNEY'S END.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-01 CHAPTER TWENTY SIX.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-02 HOW OZMA REFUSED TO FIGHT FOR HER KINGDOM OZMA WAS IN HER ROSE GARDEN PICKING A BOUQUET WHEN THE PARTY ARRIVED AND SHE GREETED ALL HER OLD AND NEW FRIENDS AS SMILINGLY AND SWEETLY AS EVER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-03 DOROTHY'S EYES WERE FULL OF TEARS AS SHE KISSED THE LOVELY RULER OF OZ AND SHE WHISPERED TO HER, OH OZMA OZMA!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-04 I'M SO SORRY!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-05 OZMA SEEMED SURPRISED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-06 SORRY FOR WHAT DOROTHY?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-07 SHE ASKED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-08 FOR ALL YOUR TROUBLE ABOUT THE NOME KING WAS THE REPLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-09 OZMA LAUGHED WITH GENUINE AMUSEMENT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-10 WHY THAT HAS NOT TROUBLED ME A BIT DEAR PRINCESS SHE REPLIED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-11 THEN LOOKING AROUND AT THE SAD FACES OF HER FRIENDS SHE ADDED, HAVE YOU ALL BEEN WORRYING ABOUT THIS TUNNEL?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-12 WE HAVE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-13 THEY EXCLAIMED IN A CHORUS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-14 WELL PERHAPS IT IS MORE SERIOUS THAN I IMAGINED ADMITTED THE FAIR RULER,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-15 BUT I HAVEN'T GIVEN THE MATTER MUCH THOUGHT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-16 AFTER DINNER WE WILL ALL MEET TOGETHER AND TALK IT OVER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-17 SO THEY WENT TO THEIR ROOMS AND PREPARED FOR DINNER AND DOROTHY DRESSED HERSELF IN HER PRETTIEST GOWN AND PUT ON HER CORONET FOR SHE THOUGHT THAT THIS MIGHT BE THE LAST TIME SHE WOULD EVER APPEAR AS A PRINCESS OF OZ. THE SCARECROW THE TIN WOODMAN AND JACK PUMPKINHEAD ALL SAT AT THE DINNER TABLE ALTHOUGH NONE OF THEM WAS MADE SO HE COULD EAT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-18 USUALLY THEY SERVED TO ENLIVEN THE MEAL WITH THEIR MERRY TALK BUT TO NIGHT ALL SEEMED STRANGELY SILENT AND UNEASY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-19 AS SOON AS THE DINNER WAS FINISHED OZMA LED THE COMPANY TO HER OWN PRIVATE ROOM IN WHICH HUNG THE MAGIC PICTURE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-20 WHEN THEY HAD SEATED THEMSELVES THE SCARECROW WAS THE FIRST TO SPEAK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-21 IS THE NOME KING'S TUNNEL FINISHED OZMA?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-22 HE ASKED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-23 IT WAS COMPLETED TO DAY SHE REPLIED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-24 THEY HAVE BUILT IT RIGHT UNDER MY PALACE GROUNDS AND IT ENDS IN FRONT OF THE FORBIDDEN FOUNTAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-25 NOTHING BUT A CRUST OF EARTH REMAINS TO SEPARATE OUR ENEMIES FROM US AND WHEN THEY MARCH HERE THEY WILL EASILY BREAK THROUGH THIS CRUST AND RUSH UPON US.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-26 WHO WILL ASSIST THE NOME KING?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-27 INQUIRED THE SCARECROW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-28 THE WHIMSIES THE GROWLEYWOGS AND THE PHANFASMS SHE REPLIED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-29 I WATCHED TO DAY IN MY MAGIC PICTURE THE MESSENGERS WHOM THE NOME KING SENT TO ALL THESE PEOPLE TO SUMMON THEM TO ASSEMBLE IN HIS GREAT CAVERNS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-30 LET US SEE WHAT THEY ARE DOING NOW SUGGESTED THE TIN WOODMAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-31 SO OZMA WISHED TO SEE THE NOME KING'S CAVERN AND AT ONCE THE LANDSCAPE FADED FROM THE MAGIC PICTURE AND WAS REPLACED BY THE SCENE THEN BEING ENACTED IN THE JEWELED CAVERN OF KING ROQUAT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-32 A WILD AND STARTLING SCENE IT WAS WHICH THE OZ PEOPLE BEHELD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-33 BEFORE THE NOME KING STOOD THE CHIEF OF THE WHIMSIES AND THE GRAND GALLIPOOT OF THE GROWLEYWOGS SURROUNDED BY THEIR MOST SKILLFUL GENERALS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-34 VERY FIERCE AND POWERFUL THEY LOOKED SO THAT EVEN THE NOME KING AND GENERAL GUPH WHO STOOD BESIDE HIS MASTER SEEMED A BIT FEARFUL IN THE PRESENCE OF THEIR ALLIES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-35 NOW A STILL MORE FORMIDABLE CREATURE ENTERED THE CAVERN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-36 IT WAS THE FIRST AND FOREMOST OF THE PHANFASMS AND HE PROUDLY SAT DOWN IN KING ROQUAT'S OWN THRONE AND DEMANDED THE RIGHT TO LEAD HIS FORCES THROUGH THE TUNNEL IN ADVANCE OF ALL THE OTHERS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-37 THE FIRST AND FOREMOST NOW APPEARED TO ALL EYES IN HIS HAIRY SKIN AND THE BEAR'S HEAD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-38 WHAT HIS REAL FORM WAS EVEN ROQUAT DID NOT KNOW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-39 THROUGH THE ARCHES LEADING INTO THE VAST SERIES OF CAVERNS THAT LAY BEYOND THE THRONE ROOM OF KING ROQUAT COULD BE SEEN RANKS UPON RANKS OF THE INVADERS THOUSANDS OF PHANFASMS GROWLEYWOGS AND WHIMSIES STANDING IN SERRIED LINES WHILE BEHIND THEM WERE MASSED THE THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS OF GENERAL GUPH'S OWN ARMY OF NOMES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-40 LISTEN!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-41 WHISPERED OZMA.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-42 I THINK WE CAN HEAR WHAT THEY ARE SAYING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-43 SO THEY KEPT STILL AND LISTENED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-44 IS ALL READY?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-45 DEMANDED THE FIRST AND FOREMOST HAUGHTILY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-46 THE TUNNEL IS FINALLY COMPLETED REPLIED GENERAL GUPH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-47 HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE US TO MARCH TO THE EMERALD CITY?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-48 ASKED THE GRAND GALLIPOOT OF THE GROWLEYWOGS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-49 IF WE START AT MIDNIGHT REPLIED THE NOME KING WE SHALL ARRIVE AT THE EMERALD CITY BY DAYBREAK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-50 THEN WHILE ALL THE OZ PEOPLE ARE SLEEPING WE WILL CAPTURE THEM AND MAKE THEM OUR SLAVES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-51 AFTER THAT WE WILL DESTROY THE CITY ITSELF AND MARCH THROUGH THE LAND OF OZ BURNING AND DEVASTATING AS WE GO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-52 GOOD!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-53 THE FIRST AND FOREMOST.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-54 WHEN WE GET THROUGH WITH OZ IT WILL BE A DESERT WILDERNESS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-55 OZMA SHALL BE MY SLAVE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-56 SHE SHALL BE MY SLAVE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-57 SHOUTED THE GRAND GALLIPOOT ANGRILY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-58 WE'LL DECIDE THAT BY AND BY SAID KING ROQUAT HASTILY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-59 DON'T LET US QUARREL NOW FRIENDS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-60 FIRST LET US CONQUER OZ AND THEN WE WILL DIVIDE THE SPOILS OF WAR IN A SATISFACTORY MANNER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-61 THE FIRST AND FOREMOST SMILED WICKEDLY,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-62 BUT HE ONLY SAID, I AND MY PHANFASMS GO FIRST FOR NOTHING ON EARTH CAN OPPOSE OUR POWER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-63 THEY ALL AGREED TO THAT KNOWING THE PHANFASMS TO BE THE MIGHTIEST OF THE COMBINED FORCES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-64 KING ROQUAT NOW INVITED THEM TO ATTEND A BANQUET HE HAD PREPARED WHERE THEY MIGHT OCCUPY THEMSELVES IN EATING AND DRINKING UNTIL MIDNIGHT ARRIVED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-65 AS THEY HAD NOW SEEN AND HEARD ALL OF THE PLOT AGAINST THEM THAT THEY CARED TO OZMA ALLOWED HER MAGIC PICTURE TO FADE AWAY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-66 THEN SHE TURNED TO HER FRIENDS AND SAID, OUR ENEMIES WILL BE HERE SOONER THAN I EXPECTED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-67 WHAT DO YOU ADVISE ME TO DO?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-68 IF YOU HAD ALLOWED ME TO ARM AND DRILL MY WINKIES WE MIGHT HAVE PUT UP A GOOD FIGHT AND DESTROYED MANY OF OUR ENEMIES BEFORE WE WERE CONQUERED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-69 AND SO ARE THE GILLIKINS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-70 BUT I DO NOT WISH TO FIGHT DECLARED OZMA FIRMLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-71 NO ONE HAS THE RIGHT TO DESTROY ANY LIVING CREATURES HOWEVER EVIL THEY MAY BE OR TO HURT THEM OR MAKE THEM UNHAPPY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-72 I WILL NOT FIGHT EVEN TO SAVE MY KINGDOM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-73 THE NOME KING IS NOT SO PARTICULAR REMARKED THE SCARECROW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-74 HE INTENDS TO DESTROY US ALL AND RUIN OUR BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-75 BECAUSE THE NOME KING INTENDS TO DO EVIL IS NO EXCUSE FOR MY DOING THE SAME REPLIED OZMA.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-76 SELF PRESERVATION IS THE FIRST LAW OF NATURE QUOTED THE SHAGGY MAN. TRUE SHE SAID READILY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-77 I WOULD LIKE TO DISCOVER A PLAN TO SAVE OURSELVES WITHOUT FIGHTING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-78 THAT SEEMED A HOPELESS TASK TO THEM BUT REALIZING THAT OZMA WAS DETERMINED NOT TO FIGHT THEY TRIED TO THINK OF SOME MEANS THAT MIGHT PROMISE ESCAPE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-79 COULDN'T WE BRIBE OUR ENEMIES BY GIVING THEM A LOT OF EMERALDS AND GOLD?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-80 ASKED JACK PUMPKINHEAD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-81 NO BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THEY ARE ABLE TO TAKE EVERYTHING WE HAVE REPLIED THE RULER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-82 I HAVE THOUGHT OF SOMETHING SAID DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-83 WHAT IS IT DEAR?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-84 ASKED OZMA.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-85 LET US USE THE MAGIC BELT TO WISH ALL OF US IN KANSAS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-86 WE WILL PUT SOME EMERALDS IN OUR POCKETS AND CAN SELL THEM IN TOPEKA FOR ENOUGH TO PAY OFF THE MORTGAGE ON UNCLE HENRY'S FARM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-87 THEN WE CAN ALL LIVE TOGETHER AND BE HAPPY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-88 A CLEVER IDEA!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-89 SCARECROW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-90 KANSAS IS A VERY GOOD COUNTRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-91 I'VE BEEN THERE SAID THE SHAGGY MAN. THAT SEEMS TO ME AN EXCELLENT PLAN APPROVED THE TIN WOODMAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-92 NO!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-93 SAID OZMA DECIDEDLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-94 NEVER WILL I DESERT MY PEOPLE AND LEAVE THEM TO SO CRUEL A FATE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-95 I WILL USE THE MAGIC BELT TO SEND THE REST OF YOU TO KANSAS IF YOU WISH BUT IF MY BELOVED COUNTRY MUST BE DESTROYED AND MY PEOPLE ENSLAVED I WILL REMAIN AND SHARE THEIR FATE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-96 QUITE RIGHT ASSERTED THE SCARECROW SIGHING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-97 I WILL REMAIN WITH YOU.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-98 AND SO WILL I DECLARED THE TIN WOODMAN AND THE SHAGGY MAN AND JACK PUMPKINHEAD IN TURN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-99 TIKTOK THE MACHINE MAN ALSO SAID HE INTENDED TO STAND BY OZMA.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-100 FOR SAID HE I SHOULD BE OF NO USE AT ALL IN KAN SAS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-101 FOR MY PART ANNOUNCED DOROTHY GRAVELY IF THE RULER OF OZ MUST NOT DESERT HER PEOPLE A PRINCESS OF OZ HAS NO RIGHT TO RUN AWAY EITHER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-102 I'M WILLING TO BECOME A SLAVE WITH THE REST OF YOU,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-103 SO ALL WE CAN DO WITH THE MAGIC BELT IS TO USE IT TO SEND UNCLE HENRY AND AUNT EM BACK TO KANSAS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-104 I'VE BEEN A SLAVE ALL MY LIFE AUNT EM REPLIED WITH CONSIDERABLE CHEERFULNESS AND SO HAS HENRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-105 I GUESS WE WON'T GO BACK TO KANSAS ANYWAY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-106 I'D RATHER TAKE MY CHANCES WITH THE REST OF YOU.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-107 OZMA SMILED UPON THEM ALL GRATEFULLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-108 THERE IS NO NEED TO DESPAIR JUST YET SHE SAID.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-109 I'LL GET UP EARLY TO MORROW MORNING AND BE AT THE FORBIDDEN FOUNTAIN WHEN THE FIERCE WARRIORS BREAK THROUGH THE CRUST OF THE EARTH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-110 I WILL SPEAK TO THEM PLEASANTLY AND PERHAPS THEY WON'T BE SO VERY BAD AFTER ALL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-111 WHY DO THEY CALL IT THE FORBIDDEN FOUNTAIN?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-112 ASKED DOROTHY THOUGHTFULLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-113 DON'T YOU KNOW DEAR?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-114 RETURNED OZMA SURPRISED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-115 NO SAID DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-116 OF COURSE I'VE SEEN THE FOUNTAIN IN THE PALACE GROUNDS EVER SINCE I FIRST CAME TO OZ,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-117 AND I'VE READ THE SIGN WHICH SAYS, ALL PERSONS ARE FORBIDDEN TO DRINK AT THIS FOUNTAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-118 BUT I NEVER KNEW WHY THEY WERE FORBIDDEN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-119 THE WATER SEEMS CLEAR AND SPARKLING AND IT BUBBLES UP IN A GOLDEN BASIN ALL THE TIME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-120 THAT WATER DECLARED OZMA GRAVELY IS THE MOST DANGEROUS THING IN ALL THE LAND OF OZ. IT IS THE WATER OF OBLIVION.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-121 WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-122 ASKED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-123 WHOEVER DRINKS AT THE FORBIDDEN FOUNTAIN AT ONCE FORGETS EVERYTHING HE HAS EVER KNOWN OZMA ASSERTED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-124 IT WOULDN'T BE A BAD WAY TO FORGET OUR TROUBLES SUGGESTED UNCLE HENRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-125 THAT IS TRUE,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-126 BUT YOU WOULD FORGET EVERYTHING ELSE AND BECOME AS IGNORANT AS A BABY RETURNED OZMA.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-127 DOES IT MAKE ONE CRAZY?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-128 NO,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-129 IT ONLY MAKES ONE FORGET REPLIED THE GIRL RULER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-130 IT IS SAID THAT ONCE LONG LONG AGO A WICKED KING RULED OZ AND MADE HIMSELF AND ALL HIS PEOPLE VERY MISERABLE AND UNHAPPY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-131 SO GLINDA THE GOOD SORCERESS PLACED THIS FOUNTAIN HERE AND THE KING DRANK OF ITS WATER AND FORGOT ALL HIS WICKEDNESS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-132 HIS MIND BECAME INNOCENT AND VACANT AND WHEN HE LEARNED THE THINGS OF LIFE AGAIN THEY WERE ALL GOOD THINGS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-133 BUT THE PEOPLE REMEMBERED HOW WICKED THEIR KING HAD BEEN AND WERE STILL AFRAID OF HIM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-134 THEREFORE HE MADE THEM ALL DRINK OF THE WATER OF OBLIVION AND FORGET EVERYTHING THEY HAD KNOWN SO THAT THEY BECAME AS SIMPLE AND INNOCENT AS THEIR KING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-135 AFTER THAT THEY ALL GREW WISE TOGETHER AND THEIR WISDOM WAS GOOD SO THAT PEACE AND HAPPINESS REIGNED IN THE LAND.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-136 BUT FOR FEAR SOME ONE MIGHT DRINK OF THE WATER AGAIN AND IN AN INSTANT FORGET ALL HE HAD LEARNED THE KING PUT THAT SIGN UPON THE FOUNTAIN WHERE IT HAS REMAINED FOR MANY CENTURIES UP TO THIS VERY DAY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-137 THEY HAD ALL LISTENED INTENTLY TO OZMA'S STORY AND WHEN SHE FINISHED SPEAKING THERE WAS A LONG PERIOD OF SILENCE WHILE ALL THOUGHT UPON THE CURIOUS MAGICAL POWER OF THE WATER OF OBLIVION.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-138 FINALLY THE SCARECROW'S PAINTED FACE TOOK ON A BROAD SMILE THAT STRETCHED THE CLOTH AS FAR AS IT WOULD GO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-139 HOW THANKFUL I AM HE SAID THAT I HAVE SUCH AN EXCELLENT ASSORTMENT OF BRAINS!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-140 I GAVE YOU THE BEST BRAINS I EVER MIXED DECLARED THE WIZARD WITH AN AIR OF PRIDE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-141 YOU DID INDEED!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-142 AGREED THE SCARECROW AND THEY WORK SO SPLENDIDLY THAT THEY HAVE FOUND A WAY TO SAVE OZ TO SAVE US ALL!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-143 I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT SAID THE WIZARD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-144 WE NEVER NEEDED SAVING MORE THAN WE DO JUST NOW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-145 DO YOU MEAN TO SAY YOU CAN SAVE US FROM THOSE AWFUL PHANFASMS AND GROWLEYWOGS AND WHIMSIES?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-146 ASKED DOROTHY EAGERLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-147 I'M SURE OF IT MY DEAR ASSERTED THE SCARECROW STILL SMILING GENIALLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-148 TELL US HOW!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-149 CRIED THE TIN WOODMAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-150 NOT NOW SAID THE SCARECROW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-151 YOU MAY ALL GO TO BED AND I ADVISE YOU TO FORGET YOUR WORRIES JUST AS COMPLETELY AS IF YOU HAD DRUNK OF THE WATER OF OBLIVION IN THE FORBIDDEN FOUNTAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-152 I'M GOING TO STAY HERE AND TELL MY PLAN TO OZMA ALONE BUT IF YOU WILL ALL BE AT THE FORBIDDEN FOUNTAIN AT DAYBREAK YOU'LL SEE HOW EASILY WE WILL SAVE THE KINGDOM WHEN OUR ENEMIES BREAK THROUGH THE CRUST OF EARTH AND COME FROM THE TUNNEL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-153 SO THEY WENT AWAY AND LET THE SCARECROW AND OZMA ALONE,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-154 BUT DOROTHY COULD NOT SLEEP A WINK ALL NIGHT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-155 HE IS ONLY A SCARECROW SHE SAID TO HERSELF AND I'M NOT SURE THAT HIS MIXED BRAINS ARE AS CLEVER AS HE THINKS THEY ARE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-156 BUT SHE KNEW THAT IF THE SCARECROW'S PLAN FAILED THEY WERE ALL LOST,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-26-157 SO SHE TRIED TO HAVE FAITH IN HIM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-27-01 CHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-27-02 HOW THE FIERCE WARRIORS INVADED OZ THE NOME KING AND HIS TERRIBLE ALLIES SAT AT THE BANQUET TABLE UNTIL MIDNIGHT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-27-03 THERE WAS MUCH QUARRELING BETWEEN THE GROWLEYWOGS AND PHANFASMS AND ONE OF THE WEE HEADED WHIMSIES GOT ANGRY AT GENERAL GUPH AND CHOKED HIM UNTIL HE NEARLY STOPPED BREATHING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-27-04 YET NO ONE WAS SERIOUSLY HURT AND THE NOME KING FELT MUCH RELIEVED WHEN THE CLOCK STRUCK TWELVE AND THEY ALL SPRANG UP AND SEIZED THEIR WEAPONS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-27-05 AHA!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-27-06 SHOUTED THE FIRST AND FOREMOST.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-27-07 NOW TO CONQUER THE LAND OF OZ!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-27-08 HE MARSHALED HIS PHANFASMS IN BATTLE ARRAY AND AT HIS WORD OF COMMAND THEY MARCHED INTO THE TUNNEL AND BEGAN THE LONG JOURNEY THROUGH IT TO THE EMERALD CITY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-27-09 THE FIRST AND FOREMOST INTENDED TO TAKE ALL THE TREASURES OF OZ FOR HIMSELF,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-27-10 TO KILL ALL WHO COULD BE KILLED AND ENSLAVE THE REST,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-27-11 TO DESTROY AND LAY WASTE THE WHOLE COUNTRY AND AFTERWARD TO CONQUER AND ENSLAVE THE NOMES THE GROWLEYWOGS AND THE WHIMSIES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-27-12 AND HE KNEW HIS POWER WAS SUFFICIENT TO ENABLE HIM TO DO ALL THESE THINGS EASILY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-27-13 NEXT MARCHED INTO THE TUNNEL THE ARMY OF GIGANTIC GROWLEYWOGS WITH THEIR GRAND GALLIPOOT AT THEIR HEAD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-27-14 THEY WERE DREADFUL BEINGS INDEED AND LONGED TO GET TO OZ THAT THEY MIGHT BEGIN TO PILFER AND DESTROY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-27-15 THE GRAND GALLIPOOT WAS A LITTLE AFRAID OF THE FIRST AND FOREMOST BUT HAD A CUNNING PLAN TO MURDER OR DESTROY THAT POWERFUL BEING AND SECURE THE WEALTH OF OZ FOR HIMSELF.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-27-16 MIGHTY LITTLE OF THE PLUNDER WOULD THE NOME KING GET THOUGHT THE GRAND GALLIPOOT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-27-17 THE CHIEF OF THE WHIMSIES NOW MARCHED HIS FALSE HEADED FORCES INTO THE TUNNEL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-27-18 IN HIS WICKED LITTLE HEAD WAS A PLOT TO DESTROY BOTH THE FIRST AND FOREMOST AND THE GRAND GALLIPOOT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-27-19 HE INTENDED TO LET THEM CONQUER OZ SINCE THEY INSISTED ON GOING FIRST,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-27-20 BUT HE WOULD AFTERWARD TREACHEROUSLY DESTROY THEM AS WELL AS KING ROQUAT AND KEEP ALL THE SLAVES AND TREASURE OF OZMA'S KINGDOM FOR HIMSELF.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-27-21 AFTER ALL HIS DANGEROUS ALLIES HAD MARCHED INTO THE TUNNEL THE NOME KING AND GENERAL GUPH STARTED TO FOLLOW THEM AT THE HEAD OF FIFTY THOUSAND NOMES ALL FULLY ARMED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-27-22 GUPH SAID THE KING THOSE CREATURES AHEAD OF US MEAN MISCHIEF.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-27-23 THEY INTEND TO GET EVERYTHING FOR THEMSELVES AND LEAVE US NOTHING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-27-24 I KNOW REPLIED THE GENERAL,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-27-25 BUT THEY ARE NOT AS CLEVER AS THEY THINK THEY ARE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-27-26 WHEN YOU GET THE MAGIC BELT YOU MUST AT ONCE WISH THE WHIMSIES AND GROWLEYWOGS AND PHANFASMS ALL BACK INTO THEIR OWN COUNTRIES AND THE BELT WILL SURELY TAKE THEM THERE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-27-27 GOOD!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-27-28 CRIED THE KING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-27-29 AN EXCELLENT PLAN GUPH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-27-30 I'LL DO IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-27-31 WHILE THEY ARE CONQUERING OZ I'LL GET THE MAGIC BELT AND THEN ONLY THE NOMES WILL REMAIN TO RAVAGE THE COUNTRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-27-32 SO YOU SEE THERE WAS ONLY ONE THING THAT ALL WERE AGREED UPON THAT OZ SHOULD BE DESTROYED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-27-33 ON ON ON THE VAST RANKS OF INVADERS MARCHED FILLING THE TUNNEL FROM SIDE TO SIDE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-27-34 WITH A STEADY TRAMP TRAMP THEY ADVANCED EVERY STEP TAKING THEM NEARER TO THE BEAUTIFUL EMERALD CITY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-27-35 NOTHING CAN SAVE THE LAND OF OZ!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-27-36 THOUGHT THE FIRST AND FOREMOST SCOWLING UNTIL HIS BEAR FACE WAS AS BLACK AS THE TUNNEL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-27-37 THE EMERALD CITY IS AS GOOD AS DESTROYED ALREADY!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-27-38 MUTTERED THE GRAND GALLIPOOT SHAKING HIS WAR CLUB FIERCELY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-27-39 IN A FEW HOURS OZ WILL BE A DESERT!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-27-40 SAID THE CHIEF OF THE WHIMSIES WITH AN EVIL LAUGH.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-27-41 MY DEAR GUPH REMARKED THE NOME KING TO HIS GENERAL AT LAST MY VENGEANCE UPON OZMA OF OZ AND HER PEOPLE IS ABOUT TO BE ACCOMPLISHED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-27-42 YOU ARE RIGHT!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-27-43 DECLARED THE GENERAL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-27-44 OZMA IS SURELY LOST.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-27-45 AND NOW THE FIRST AND FOREMOST WHO WAS IN ADVANCE AND NEARING THE EMERALD CITY BEGAN TO COUGH AND TO SNEEZE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-27-46 THIS TUNNEL IS TERRIBLY DUSTY HE GROWLED ANGRILY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-27-47 I'LL PUNISH THAT NOME KING FOR NOT HAVING IT SWEPT CLEAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-27-48 MY THROAT AND EYES ARE GETTING FULL OF DUST AND I'M AS THIRSTY AS A FISH!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-27-49 THE GRAND GALLIPOOT WAS COUGHING TOO AND HIS THROAT WAS PARCHED AND DRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-27-50 WHAT A DUSTY PLACE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-27-51 HE CRIED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-27-52 I'LL BE GLAD WHEN WE REACH OZ WHERE WE CAN GET A DRINK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-27-53 WHO HAS ANY WATER?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-27-54 ASKED THE WHIMSIE CHIEF GASPING AND CHOKING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-27-55 BUT NONE OF HIS FOLLOWERS CARRIED A DROP OF WATER SO HE HASTENED ON TO GET THROUGH THE DUSTY TUNNEL TO THE LAND OF OZ. WHERE DID ALL THIS DUST COME FROM?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-27-56 DEMANDED GENERAL GUPH TRYING HARD TO SWALLOW BUT FINDING HIS THROAT SO DRY HE COULDN'T.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-27-57 I DON'T KNOW ANSWERED THE NOME KING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-27-58 I'VE BEEN IN THE TUNNEL EVERY DAY WHILE IT WAS BEING BUILT BUT I NEVER NOTICED ANY DUST BEFORE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-27-59 LET'S HURRY!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-27-60 CRIED THE GENERAL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-27-61 I'D GIVE HALF THE GOLD IN OZ FOR A DRINK OF WATER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-27-62 THE DUST GREW THICKER AND THICKER AND THE THROATS AND EYES AND NOSES OF THE INVADERS WERE FILLED WITH IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-27-63 BUT NOT ONE HALTED OR TURNED BACK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-27-64 THEY HURRIED FORWARD MORE FIERCE AND VENGEFUL THAN EVER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-01 CHAPTER TWENTY EIGHT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-02 HOW THEY DRANK AT THE FORBIDDEN FOUNTAIN THE SCARECROW HAD NO NEED TO SLEEP,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-03 NEITHER HAD THE TIN WOODMAN OR TIKTOK OR JACK PUMPKINHEAD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-04 SO THEY ALL WANDERED OUT INTO THE PALACE GROUNDS AND STOOD BESIDE THE SPARKLING WATER OF THE FORBIDDEN FOUNTAIN UNTIL DAYBREAK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-05 DURING THIS TIME THEY INDULGED IN OCCASIONAL CONVERSATION.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-06 NOTHING COULD MAKE ME FORGET WHAT I KNOW REMARKED THE SCARECROW GAZING INTO THE FOUNTAIN FOR I CANNOT DRINK THE WATER OF OBLIVION OR WATER OF ANY KIND.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-07 AND I AM GLAD THAT THIS IS SO FOR I CONSIDER MY WISDOM UNEXCELLED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-08 YOU ARE CER TAIN LY VE RY WISE AGREED TIKTOK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-09 FOR MY PART I CAN ON LY THINK BY MA CHIN ER Y SO I DO NOT PRE TEND TO KNOW AS MUCH AS YOU DO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-10 MY TIN BRAINS ARE VERY BRIGHT BUT THAT IS ALL I CLAIM FOR THEM SAID NICK CHOPPER MODESTLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-11 YET I DO NOT ASPIRE TO BEING VERY WISE FOR I HAVE NOTICED THAT THE HAPPIEST PEOPLE ARE THOSE WHO DO NOT LET THEIR BRAINS OPPRESS THEM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-12 MINE NEVER WORRY ME JACK PUMPKINHEAD ACKNOWLEDGED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-13 THERE ARE MANY SEEDS OF THOUGHT IN MY HEAD BUT THEY DO NOT SPROUT EASILY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-14 I AM GLAD THAT IT IS SO FOR IF I OCCUPIED MY DAYS IN THINKING I SHOULD HAVE NO TIME FOR ANYTHING ELSE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-15 IN THIS CHEERY MOOD THEY PASSED THE HOURS UNTIL THE FIRST GOLDEN STREAKS OF DAWN APPEARED IN THE SKY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-16 THEN OZMA JOINED THEM AS FRESH AND LOVELY AS EVER AND ROBED IN ONE OF HER PRETTIEST GOWNS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-17 OUR ENEMIES HAVE NOT YET ARRIVED SAID THE SCARECROW AFTER GREETING AFFECTIONATELY THE SWEET AND GIRLISH RULER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-18 THEY WILL SOON BE HERE SHE SAID FOR I HAVE JUST GLANCED AT MY MAGIC PICTURE AND HAVE SEEN THEM COUGHING AND CHOKING WITH THE DUST IN THE TUNNEL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-19 OH IS THERE DUST IN THE TUNNEL?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-20 ASKED THE TIN WOODMAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-21 YES,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-22 OZMA PLACED IT THERE BY MEANS OF THE MAGIC BELT EXPLAINED THE SCARECROW WITH ONE OF HIS BROAD SMILES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-23 THEN DOROTHY CAME TO THEM UNCLE HENRY AND AUNT EM FOLLOWING CLOSE AFTER HER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-24 THE LITTLE GIRL'S EYES WERE HEAVY BECAUSE SHE HAD HAD A SLEEPLESS AND ANXIOUS NIGHT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-25 TOTO WALKED BY HER SIDE BUT THE LITTLE DOG'S SPIRITS WERE VERY MUCH SUBDUED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-26 BILLINA WHO WAS ALWAYS UP BY DAYBREAK WAS NOT LONG IN JOINING THE GROUP BY THE FOUNTAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-27 THE WIZARD AND THE SHAGGY MAN NEXT ARRIVED AND SOON AFTER APPEARED OMBY AMBY DRESSED IN HIS BEST UNIFORM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-28 THERE LIES THE TUNNEL SAID OZMA POINTING TO A PART OF THE GROUND JUST BEFORE THE FORBIDDEN FOUNTAIN AND IN A FEW MOMENTS THE DREADFUL INVADERS WILL BREAK THROUGH THE EARTH AND SWARM OVER THE LAND.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-29 LET US ALL STAND ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FOUNTAIN AND WATCH TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-30 AT ONCE THEY FOLLOWED HER SUGGESTION AND MOVED AROUND THE FOUNTAIN OF THE WATER OF OBLIVION.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-31 THERE THEY STOOD SILENT AND EXPECTANT UNTIL THE EARTH BEYOND GAVE WAY WITH A SUDDEN CRASH AND UP LEAPED THE POWERFUL FORM OF THE FIRST AND FOREMOST FOLLOWED BY ALL HIS GRIM WARRIORS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-32 AS THE LEADER SPRANG FORWARD HIS GLEAMING EYES CAUGHT THE PLAY OF THE FOUNTAIN AND HE RUSHED TOWARD IT AND DRANK EAGERLY OF THE SPARKLING WATER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-33 MANY OF THE OTHER PHANFASMS DRANK TOO IN ORDER TO CLEAR THEIR DRY AND DUSTY THROATS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-34 THEN THEY STOOD AROUND AND LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER WITH SIMPLE WONDERING SMILES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-35 THE FIRST AND FOREMOST SAW OZMA AND HER COMPANIONS BEYOND THE FOUNTAIN BUT INSTEAD OF MAKING AN EFFORT TO CAPTURE HER HE MERELY STARED AT HER IN PLEASED ADMIRATION OF HER BEAUTY FOR HE HAD FORGOTTEN WHERE HE WAS AND WHY HE HAD COME THERE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-36 BUT NOW THE GRAND GALLIPOOT ARRIVED RUSHING FROM THE TUNNEL WITH A HOARSE CRY OF MINGLED RAGE AND THIRST.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-37 HE TOO SAW THE FOUNTAIN AND HASTENED TO DRINK OF ITS FORBIDDEN WATERS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-38 THE OTHER GROWLEYWOGS WERE NOT SLOW TO FOLLOW SUIT AND EVEN BEFORE THEY HAD FINISHED DRINKING THE CHIEF OF THE WHIMSIES AND HIS PEOPLE CAME TO PUSH THEM AWAY WHILE THEY ONE AND ALL CAST OFF THEIR FALSE HEADS THAT THEY MIGHT SLAKE THEIR THIRST AT THE FOUNTAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-39 WHEN THE NOME KING AND GENERAL GUPH ARRIVED THEY BOTH MADE A DASH TO DRINK BUT THE GENERAL WAS SO MAD WITH THIRST THAT HE KNOCKED HIS KING OVER AND WHILE ROQUAT LAY SPRAWLING UPON THE GROUND THE GENERAL DRANK HEARTILY OF THE WATER OF OBLIVION.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-40 THIS RUDE ACT OF HIS GENERAL MADE THE NOME KING SO ANGRY THAT FOR A MOMENT HE FORGOT HE WAS THIRSTY AND ROSE TO HIS FEET TO GLARE UPON THE GROUP OF TERRIBLE WARRIORS HE HAD BROUGHT HERE TO ASSIST HIM.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-41 HE SAW OZMA AND HER PEOPLE TOO AND YELLED OUT, WHY DON'T YOU CAPTURE THEM?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-42 WHY DON'T YOU CONQUER OZ YOU IDIOTS?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-43 WHY DO YOU STAND THERE LIKE A LOT OF DUMMIES?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-44 BUT THE GREAT WARRIORS HAD BECOME LIKE LITTLE CHILDREN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-45 THEY HAD FORGOTTEN ALL THEIR ENMITY AGAINST OZMA AND AGAINST OZ. THEY HAD EVEN FORGOTTEN WHO THEY THEMSELVES WERE OR WHY THEY WERE IN THIS STRANGE AND BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-46 AS FOR THE NOME KING THEY DID NOT RECOGNIZE HIM AND WONDERED WHO HE WAS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-47 THE SUN CAME UP AND SENT ITS FLOOD OF SILVER RAYS TO LIGHT THE FACES OF THE INVADERS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-48 THE FROWNS AND SCOWLS AND EVIL LOOKS WERE ALL GONE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-49 EVEN THE MOST MONSTROUS OF THE CREATURES THERE ASSEMBLED SMILED INNOCENTLY AND SEEMED LIGHT HEARTED AND CONTENT MERELY TO BE ALIVE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-50 NOT SO WITH ROQUAT THE NOME KING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-51 HE HAD NOT DRUNK FROM THE FORBIDDEN FOUNTAIN AND ALL HIS FORMER RAGE AGAINST OZMA AND DOROTHY NOW INFLAMED HIM AS FIERCELY AS EVER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-52 THE SIGHT OF GENERAL GUPH BABBLING LIKE A HAPPY CHILD AND PLAYING WITH HIS HANDS IN THE COOL WATERS OF THE FOUNTAIN ASTONISHED AND MADDENED RED ROQUAT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-53 SEEING THAT HIS TERRIBLE ALLIES AND HIS OWN GENERAL REFUSED TO ACT THE NOME KING TURNED TO ORDER HIS GREAT ARMY OF NOMES TO ADVANCE FROM THE TUNNEL AND SEIZE THE HELPLESS OZ PEOPLE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-54 BUT THE SCARECROW SUSPECTED WHAT WAS IN THE KING'S MIND AND SPOKE A WORD TO THE TIN WOODMAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-55 TOGETHER THEY RAN AT ROQUAT AND GRABBING HIM UP TOSSED HIM INTO THE GREAT BASIN OF THE FOUNTAIN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-56 THE NOME KING'S BODY WAS ROUND AS A BALL AND IT BOBBED UP AND DOWN IN THE WATER OF OBLIVION WHILE HE SPLUTTERED AND SCREAMED WITH FEAR LEST HE SHOULD DROWN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-57 AND WHEN HE CRIED OUT HIS MOUTH FILLED WITH WATER WHICH RAN DOWN HIS THROAT SO THAT STRAIGHTWAY HE FORGOT ALL HE HAD FORMERLY KNOWN JUST AS COMPLETELY AS HAD ALL THE OTHER INVADERS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-58 OZMA AND DOROTHY COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM LAUGHING TO SEE THEIR DREADED ENEMIES BECOME AS HARMLESS AS BABIES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-59 THERE WAS NO DANGER NOW THAT OZ WOULD BE DESTROYED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-60 THE ONLY QUESTION REMAINING TO SOLVE WAS HOW TO GET RID OF THIS HORDE OF INTRUDERS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-61 THE SHAGGY MAN KINDLY PULLED THE NOME KING OUT OF THE FOUNTAIN AND SET HIM UPON HIS THIN LEGS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-62 ROQUAT WAS DRIPPING WET BUT HE CHATTERED AND LAUGHED AND WANTED TO DRINK MORE OF THE WATER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-63 NO THOUGHT OF INJURING ANY PERSON WAS NOW IN HIS MIND.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-64 BEFORE HE LEFT THE TUNNEL HE HAD COMMANDED HIS FIFTY THOUSAND NOMES TO REMAIN THERE UNTIL HE ORDERED THEM TO ADVANCE AS HE WISHED TO GIVE HIS ALLIES TIME TO CONQUER OZ BEFORE HE APPEARED WITH HIS OWN ARMY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-65 OZMA DID NOT WISH ALL THESE NOMES TO OVERRUN HER LAND SO SHE ADVANCED TO KING ROQUAT AND TAKING HIS HAND IN HER OWN SAID GENTLY, WHO ARE YOU?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-66 WHAT IS YOUR NAME?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-67 I DON'T KNOW HE REPLIED SMILING AT HER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-68 WHO ARE YOU MY DEAR?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-69 MY NAME IS OZMA SHE SAID,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-70 AND YOUR NAME IS ROQUAT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-71 OH IS IT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-72 HE REPLIED SEEMING PLEASED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-73 YES,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-74 YOU ARE KING OF THE NOMES SHE SAID.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-75 AH,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-76 I WONDER WHAT THE NOMES ARE!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-77 RETURNED THE KING AS IF PUZZLED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-78 THEY ARE UNDERGROUND ELVES AND THAT TUNNEL OVER THERE IS FULL OF THEM SHE ANSWERED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-79 YOU HAVE A BEAUTIFUL CAVERN AT THE OTHER END OF THE TUNNEL SO YOU MUST GO TO YOUR NOMES AND SAY, MARCH HOME!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-80 THEN FOLLOW AFTER THEM AND IN TIME YOU WILL REACH THE PRETTY CAVERN WHERE YOU LIVE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-81 THE NOME KING WAS MUCH PLEASED TO LEARN THIS FOR HE HAD FORGOTTEN HE HAD A CAVERN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-82 SO HE WENT TO THE TUNNEL AND SAID TO HIS ARMY, MARCH HOME!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-83 AT ONCE THE NOMES TURNED AND MARCHED BACK THROUGH THE TUNNEL AND THE KING FOLLOWED AFTER THEM LAUGHING WITH DELIGHT TO FIND HIS ORDERS SO READILY OBEYED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-84 THE WIZARD WENT TO GENERAL GUPH WHO WAS TRYING TO COUNT HIS FINGERS AND TOLD HIM TO FOLLOW THE NOME KING WHO WAS HIS MASTER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-85 GUPH MEEKLY OBEYED AND SO ALL THE NOMES QUITTED THE LAND OF OZ FOREVER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-86 BUT THERE WERE STILL THE PHANFASMS AND WHIMSIES AND GROWLEYWOGS STANDING AROUND IN GROUPS AND THEY WERE SO MANY THAT THEY FILLED THE GARDENS AND TRAMPLED UPON THE FLOWERS AND GRASS BECAUSE THEY DID NOT KNOW THAT THE TENDER PLANTS WOULD BE INJURED BY THEIR CLUMSY FEET.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-87 BUT IN ALL OTHER RESPECTS THEY WERE PERFECTLY HARMLESS AND PLAYED TOGETHER LIKE CHILDREN OR GAZED WITH PLEASURE UPON THE PRETTY SIGHTS OF THE ROYAL GARDENS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-88 AFTER COUNSELING WITH THE SCARECROW OZMA SENT OMBY AMBY TO THE PALACE FOR THE MAGIC BELT AND WHEN THE CAPTAIN GENERAL RETURNED WITH IT THE RULER OF OZ AT ONCE CLASPED THE PRECIOUS BELT AROUND HER WAIST.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-89 I WISH ALL THESE STRANGE PEOPLE THE WHIMSIES AND THE GROWLEYWOGS AND THE PHANFASMS SAFE BACK IN THEIR OWN HOMES!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-90 SHE SAID.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-91 IT ALL HAPPENED IN A TWINKLING FOR OF COURSE THE WISH WAS NO SOONER SPOKEN THAN IT WAS GRANTED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-28-92 ALL THE HOSTS OF THE INVADERS WERE GONE AND ONLY THE TRAMPLED GRASS SHOWED THAT THEY HAD EVER BEEN IN THE LAND OF OZ.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-01 CHAPTER TWENTY NINE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-02 HOW GLINDA WORKED A MAGIC SPELL THAT WAS BETTER THAN FIGHTING SAID OZMA WHEN ALL OUR FRIENDS WERE ASSEMBLED IN THE PALACE AFTER THE EXCITING EVENTS OF THE MORNING,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-03 AND EACH AND EVERY ONE AGREED WITH HER.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-04 NO ONE WAS HURT SAID THE WIZARD DELIGHTEDLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-05 AND NO ONE HURT US ADDED AUNT EM. BUT BEST OF ALL SAID DOROTHY THE WICKED PEOPLE HAVE ALL FORGOTTEN THEIR WICKEDNESS AND WILL NOT WISH TO HURT ANY ONE AFTER THIS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-06 TRUE PRINCESS DECLARED THE SHAGGY MAN. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT TO HAVE REFORMED ALL THOSE EVIL CHARACTERS IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN TO HAVE SAVED OZ. NEVERTHELESS REMARKED THE SCARECROW I AM GLAD OZ IS SAVED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-07 I CAN NOW GO BACK TO MY NEW MANSION AND LIVE HAPPILY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-08 AND I AM GLAD AND GRATEFUL THAT MY PUMPKIN FARM IS SAVED SAID JACK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-09 FOR MY PART ADDED THE TIN WOODMAN I CANNOT EXPRESS MY JOY THAT MY LOVELY TIN CASTLE IS NOT TO BE DEMOLISHED BY WICKED ENEMIES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-10 STILL SAID TIKTOK O THER EN E MIES MAY COME TO OZ SOME DAY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-11 WHY DO YOU ALLOW YOUR CLOCK WORK BRAINS TO INTERRUPT OUR JOY?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-12 ASKED OMBY AMBY FROWNING AT THE MACHINE MAN.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-13 I SAY WHAT I AM WOUND UP TO SAY ANSWERED TIKTOK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-14 AND YOU ARE RIGHT DECLARED OZMA.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-15 I MYSELF HAVE BEEN THINKING OF THIS VERY IDEA AND IT SEEMS TO ME THERE ARE ENTIRELY TOO MANY WAYS FOR PEOPLE TO GET TO THE LAND OF OZ. WE USED TO THINK THE DEADLY DESERT THAT SURROUNDS US WAS ENOUGH PROTECTION,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-16 BUT THAT IS NO LONGER THE CASE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-17 THE WIZARD AND DOROTHY HAVE BOTH COME HERE THROUGH THE AIR AND I AM TOLD THE EARTH PEOPLE HAVE INVENTED AIRSHIPS THAT CAN FLY ANYWHERE THEY WISH THEM TO GO.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-18 WHY SOMETIMES THEY DO AND SOMETIMES THEY DON'T ASSERTED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-19 BUT IN TIME THE AIRSHIPS MAY CAUSE US TROUBLE CONTINUED OZMA FOR IF THE EARTH FOLK LEARN HOW TO MANAGE THEM WE WOULD BE OVERRUN WITH VISITORS WHO WOULD RUIN OUR LOVELY SECLUDED FAIRYLAND.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-20 THAT IS TRUE ENOUGH AGREED THE WIZARD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-21 ALSO THE DESERT FAILS TO PROTECT US IN OTHER WAYS OZMA WENT ON THOUGHTFULLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-22 JOHNNY DOOIT ONCE MADE A SAND BOAT THAT SAILED ACROSS IT AND THE NOME KING MADE A TUNNEL UNDER IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-23 SO I BELIEVE SOMETHING OUGHT TO BE DONE TO CUT US OFF FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD ENTIRELY SO THAT NO ONE IN THE FUTURE WILL EVER BE ABLE TO INTRUDE UPON US.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-24 HOW WILL YOU DO THAT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-25 ASKED THE SCARECROW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-26 I DO NOT KNOW,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-27 BUT IN SOME WAY I AM SURE IT CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-28 TO MORROW I WILL MAKE A JOURNEY TO THE CASTLE OF GLINDA THE GOOD AND ASK HER ADVICE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-29 MAY I GO WITH YOU?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-30 ASKED DOROTHY EAGERLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-31 OF COURSE MY DEAR PRINCESS,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-32 AND I ALSO INVITE ANY OF OUR FRIENDS HERE WHO WOULD LIKE TO UNDERTAKE THE JOURNEY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-33 THEY ALL DECLARED THEY WISHED TO ACCOMPANY THEIR GIRL RULER FOR THIS WAS INDEED AN IMPORTANT MISSION SINCE THE FUTURE OF THE LAND OF OZ TO A GREAT EXTENT DEPENDED UPON IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-34 SO OZMA GAVE ORDERS TO HER SERVANTS TO PREPARE FOR THE JOURNEY ON THE MORROW.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-35 THAT DAY SHE WATCHED HER MAGIC PICTURE AND WHEN IT SHOWED HER THAT ALL THE NOMES HAD RETURNED THROUGH THE TUNNEL TO THEIR UNDERGROUND CAVERNS OZMA USED THE MAGIC BELT TO CLOSE UP THE TUNNEL SO THAT THE EARTH UNDERNEATH THE DESERT SANDS BECAME AS SOLID AS IT WAS BEFORE THE NOMES BEGAN TO DIG.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-36 EARLY THE FOLLOWING MORNING A GAY CAVALCADE SET OUT TO VISIT THE FAMOUS SORCERESS GLINDA THE GOOD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-37 OZMA AND DOROTHY RODE IN A CHARIOT DRAWN BY THE COWARDLY LION AND THE HUNGRY TIGER WHILE THE SAWHORSE DREW THE RED WAGON IN WHICH RODE THE REST OF THE PARTY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-38 WITH HEARTS LIGHT AND FREE FROM CARE THEY TRAVELED MERRILY ALONG THROUGH THE LOVELY AND FASCINATING LAND OF OZ AND IN GOOD SEASON REACHED THE STATELY CASTLE IN WHICH RESIDED THE SORCERESS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-39 GLINDA KNEW THAT THEY WERE COMING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-40 I HAVE BEEN READING ABOUT YOU IN MY MAGIC BOOK SHE SAID AS SHE GREETED THEM IN HER GRACIOUS WAY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-41 WHAT IS YOUR MAGIC BOOK LIKE?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-42 INQUIRED AUNT EM CURIOUSLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-43 IT IS A RECORD OF EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS REPLIED THE SORCERESS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-44 AS SOON AS AN EVENT TAKES PLACE ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD IT IS IMMEDIATELY FOUND PRINTED IN MY MAGIC BOOK.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-45 SO WHEN I READ ITS PAGES I AM WELL INFORMED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-46 DID IT TELL YOU HOW OUR ENEMIES DRANK THE WATER OF BLIVION?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-47 ASKED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-48 YES MY DEAR,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-49 IT TOLD ALL ABOUT IT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-50 AND ALSO IT TOLD ME YOU WERE ALL COMING TO MY CASTLE AND WHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-51 THEN SAID OZMA I SUPPOSE YOU KNOW WHAT IS IN MY MIND AND THAT I AM SEEKING A WAY TO PREVENT ANY ONE IN THE FUTURE FROM DISCOVERING THE LAND OF OZ. YES,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-52 I KNOW THAT.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-53 AND WHILE YOU WERE ON YOUR JOURNEY I HAVE THOUGHT OF A WAY TO ACCOMPLISH YOUR DESIRE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-54 FOR IT SEEMS TO ME UNWISE TO ALLOW TOO MANY OUTSIDE PEOPLE TO COME HERE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-55 DOROTHY WITH HER UNCLE AND AUNT HAS NOW RETURNED TO OZ TO LIVE ALWAYS AND THERE IS NO REASON WHY WE SHOULD LEAVE ANY WAY OPEN FOR OTHERS TO TRAVEL UNINVITED TO OUR FAIRYLAND.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-56 LET US MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANY ONE EVER TO COMMUNICATE WITH US IN ANY WAY AFTER THIS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-57 THEN WE MAY LIVE PEACEFULLY AND CONTENTEDLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-58 YOUR ADVICE IS WISE RETURNED OZMA.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-59 I THANK YOU GLINDA FOR YOUR PROMISE TO ASSIST ME.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-60 BUT HOW CAN YOU DO IT?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-61 ASKED DOROTHY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-62 HOW CAN YOU KEEP EVERY ONE FROM EVER FINDING OZ?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-63 BY MAKING OUR COUNTRY INVISIBLE TO ALL EYES BUT OUR OWN REPLIED THE SORCERESS SMILING.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-64 I HAVE A MAGIC CHARM POWERFUL ENOUGH TO ACCOMPLISH THAT WONDERFUL FEAT AND NOW THAT WE HAVE BEEN WARNED OF OUR DANGER BY THE NOME KING'S INVASION I BELIEVE WE MUST NOT HESITATE TO SEPARATE OURSELVES FOREVER FROM ALL THE REST OF THE WORLD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-65 I AGREE WITH YOU SAID THE RULER OF OZ. WON'T IT MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE TO US?
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-66 ASKED DOROTHY DOUBTFULLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-67 NO MY DEAR GLINDA ANSWERED ASSURINGLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-68 WE SHALL STILL BE ABLE TO SEE EACH OTHER AND EVERYTHING IN THE LAND OF OZ. IT WON'T AFFECT US AT ALL,
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-69 BUT THOSE WHO FLY THROUGH THE AIR OVER OUR COUNTRY WILL LOOK DOWN AND SEE NOTHING AT ALL.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-70 THOSE WHO COME TO THE EDGE OF THE DESERT OR TRY TO CROSS IT WILL CATCH NO GLIMPSE OF OZ OR KNOW IN WHAT DIRECTION IT LIES.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-71 NO ONE WILL TRY TO TUNNEL TO US AGAIN BECAUSE WE CANNOT BE SEEN AND THEREFORE CANNOT BE FOUND.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-72 IN OTHER WORDS THE LAND OF OZ WILL ENTIRELY DISAPPEAR FROM THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE REST OF THE WORLD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-73 THAT'S ALL RIGHT SAID DOROTHY CHEERFULLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-74 YOU MAY MAKE OZ INVIS'BLE AS SOON AS YOU PLEASE FOR ALL I CARE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-75 IT IS ALREADY INVISIBLE GLINDA STATED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-76 I KNEW OZMA'S WISHES AND PERFORMED THE MAGIC SPELL BEFORE YOU ARRIVED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-77 OZMA SEIZED THE HAND OF THE SORCERESS AND PRESSED IT GRATEFULLY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-78 THANK YOU!
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-29-79 SHE SAID.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-30-01 CHAPTER THIRTY.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-30-02 HOW THE STORY OF OZ CAME TO AN END THE WRITER OF THESE OZ STORIES HAS RECEIVED A LITTLE NOTE FROM PRINCESS DOROTHY OF OZ WHICH FOR A TIME HAS MADE HIM FEEL RATHER DISCONCERTED.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-30-03 THE NOTE WAS WRITTEN ON A BROAD WHITE FEATHER FROM A STORK'S WING AND IT SAID, YOU WILL NEVER HEAR ANYTHING MORE ABOUT OZ BECAUSE WE ARE NOW CUT OFF FOREVER FROM ALL THE REST OF THE WORLD.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-30-04 BUT TOTO AND I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU AND ALL THE OTHER CHILDREN WHO LOVE US.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-30-05 DOROTHY GALE.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-30-06 THIS SEEMED TO ME TOO BAD AT FIRST FOR OZ IS A VERY INTERESTING FAIRYLAND.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-30-07 STILL WE HAVE NO RIGHT TO FEEL GRIEVED FOR WE HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF THE HISTORY OF THE LAND OF OZ TO FILL SIX STORY BOOKS AND FROM ITS QUAINT PEOPLE AND THEIR STRANGE ADVENTURES WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO LEARN MANY USEFUL AND AMUSING THINGS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-30-08 SO GOOD LUCK TO LITTLE DOROTHY AND HER COMPANIONS.
l._frank_baum_CB-OZ-30-09 MAY THEY LIVE LONG IN THEIR INVISIBLE COUNTRY AND BE VERY HAPPY!
