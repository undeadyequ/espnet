Ses01F_script02_1_M015 aw . do you know i should have brought a six pack too . a six pack that would be just the ticket right about now . huh ?
Ses01F_script02_1_M016 god i m so excited i m like a kid . i can t believe i got out of the house with my fly zipped up .
Ses01F_script02_1_M017 i wonder if they can hear me talk or like feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around .
Ses01F_script02_1_M018 do you want my jacket ?
Ses01F_script02_1_M019 what ? we just got here . what s the point of coming all the way down here if we just turn around and go home ?
Ses01F_script02_1_M020 right .
Ses01F_script02_1_M021 wait that s my point too .
Ses01F_script02_1_M022 no no . okay . that s not my point . my point is there is no point in coming down here if we just turn around and go home . don t you want to see it ?
Ses01F_script02_1_M023 why not ?
Ses01F_script02_1_M024 honey this is like a natural phenomenon . i mean . . . people in kansas would have to get plane reservations and get hotel rooms to see this . it s just forty minutes away for us it s too good to pass up .
Ses01F_script02_1_M025 yeah . but this . .this moment on the beach is like the highlight of their little lives . all that flopping around is laying eggs or what to do spawning or mating or whatever .
Ses01F_script02_1_M026 this is a big night for these little guys . it s like life s last orgy .
Ses01F_script02_1_M027 yeah they do .
Ses01F_script02_1_M028 okay . . . well whatever . but it s a fish who do something no other fish do . it s like those swallows returning to capistrano or like those lemmings that throw themselves off the cliffs .
Ses01F_script02_1_M029 there s like mystery here there s magic . it s like a little bit of the unexplainable . i just can t see how you re not interested .
Ses01F_script02_1_M030 for real ?
Ses01F_script02_1_M031 god i don t get it . you know the first time we came here you said it was the best night of your life ?
Ses01F_script02_1_M032 and last year i remember distinctly you said you were so excited to get here that you don t remember you stubbed your toe until we were in the car .
Ses01F_script02_1_M033 ahh . . .we weren t in a good spot .
Ses01F_script02_1_M034 we just weren t in a good spot . i m telling you this is a much better spot . i have instincts for these things .
Ses01F_script02_1_M035 look there see ? what s that ? no that s that s just seaweed .
Ses01F_script02_1_M036 god this is great . think about this . i know you are not interested but just think about this .
Ses01F_script02_1_M037 right now out there there is this mass of silver fish and it s heading this way . no one sent them an invitation no one told them no one even gave them a map .
Ses01F_script02_1_M038 just all at once they turned and they formed this line as long as the california coast . and some instinctual little firecracker went off in their bodies and they all just turned as one and started swimming .
Ses01F_script02_1_M039 they are swimming right now . they are swimming as if that is the only thing that matters to them .
Ses01F_script02_1_M040 it s single mindedness with no mind . it is urgency that is just pure urge .
Ses01F_script02_1_M041 and they are swimming right now to this very point where we stand for this huge celebration of sex and death .
Ses01F_script02_1_M042 oh look . i m giving myself goose bumps my hairs are standing up on my arm .
Ses01F_script02_1_M043 so what do you think ?
Ses01F_script02_1_M044 about all of that about all i was talking about .
Ses01F_script03_2_F000 and very much sillier .
Ses01F_script03_2_F001 oh . you knew there was nothing in that .
Ses01F_script03_2_F002 presents ? it was only a trivial little brooch .
Ses01F_script03_2_F003 it was not . i still have it and i wear it often . it is very pretty .
Ses01F_script03_2_F004 i did not . you worked that whole thing up in your jealous imagination .
Ses01F_script03_2_F005 well what of it ?
Ses01F_script03_2_F006 it gave him a lot of pleasure and it didn t hurt me .
Ses01F_script03_2_F007 if you hadn t been so suspicious and nosey you never would have known a thing about it .
Ses01F_script03_2_F008 oh dear . i m bored with this conversation .

Ses01F_script03_2_F023 mind your own business .
Ses01F_script03_2_F024 you re quite insufferable i expect it s because you are drunk .
Ses01F_script03_2_F025 you ve always had a weak head .
Ses01F_script03_2_F026 on the contrary a child of two can get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy .
Ses01F_script03_2_F027 oh shut up .
Ses01F_script03_2_F028 shut up .
Ses01F_script03_2_F029 not very funny darling . why don t you have some more brandy .

Ses01F_script03_2_M000 we were very much younger then .
Ses01F_script03_2_M001 however i believe the real cause of that row was peter burden .
Ses01F_script03_2_M002 i knew nothing of the sort . you took presents from him .
Ses01F_script03_2_M003 it was bristling with diamonds . in the worst possible taste too .
Ses01F_script03_2_M004 you went out of your way to torture me over peter burden .
Ses01F_script03_2_M005 well you let him kiss you huh ? you said you did .
Ses01F_script03_2_M006 what of it ?
Ses01F_script03_2_M007 what about me ?

Ses01F_script03_2_M009 so am i . i m bored stiff . garbage do you want some brandy ?
Ses01F_script03_2_M010 i ll have a little i think .
Ses01F_script03_2_M011 no particular reason . anyhow they are very small ones .
Ses01F_script03_2_M012 you can hardly call three glasses of liquor a whole evening long going on and on and on .
Ses01F_script03_2_M013 oh . don t be so grand . just because you don t happen to want one at the moment .
Ses01F_script03_2_M014 really amanda .

Ses01F_script03_2_M022 nonsense . they have a bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap . they snap .
Ses01F_script03_2_M023 did you see much of peter burden after our divorce ?
Ses01F_script03_2_M024 and i suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more than too . yes . i suppose you guys had a riotous time huh ? all out no restraint at all . well you never really had much anyhow .
Ses01F_script03_2_M025 i think i am not in the least bit drunk .
Ses01F_script03_2_M026 i think i mentioned once before that i ve had three minute liquor glasses the whole evening long . a child of two cannot get drunk on that .
Ses01F_script03_2_M027 that s very interesting amanda . how about a child of four ? or a child of six ? or a child of nine ? we can get a good little conversation going on about this you know intemperate tots .
Ses01F_script03_2_M028  laughter that s a very good idea . i think i will .
Ses01F_script03_2_M029 look you better turn that off . i don t want to wake up the people upstairs .
Ses01F_script03_2_M030 well then you ll wake up the people downstairs .
Ses01F_script03_2_M031 this is no time of year for tunis .
Ses01F_script03_2_M032 i will do no such thing .

Ses01F_script01_3_M023 yeah . i suppose i have been . but it s going from me .
Ses01F_script01_3_M024 i don t even know how to start .
Ses01F_script01_3_M025 it s just all mixed up with so many other things you know ? you know overseas i was in command of a company ?
Ses01F_script01_3_M026 well i lost them .
Ses01F_script01_3_M027 pretty much all .
Ses01F_script01_3_M028 you can t just toss off a thing like that because they weren t just men . you know ?
Ses01F_script01_3_M029 like for instance there was this one time it had been raining for several days and this kid he just came up to me and he gave me his last pair of dry socks . he just put them in my pocket . that s a little thing you know but that s what kind of guys i had .
Ses01F_script01_3_M030 they didn t die they killed themselves for each other . i mean that exactly . just a little more selfish and they would all be here today .
Ses01F_script01_3_M031 and i had this idea as i was watching them go down . everything was being destroyed you know but this one thing was being made . it was kind of a monument it s kind of responsibility man for man .
Ses01F_script01_3_M032 to bring that on to the earth again you know is like some kind of monument and i thought i would just make a difference to them .
Ses01F_script01_3_M033 but then i came home and it was incredible you know ? the whole thing was just kind of this random bus accident . you know i went back to the rat race again i went to work .
Ses01F_script01_3_M034 driving my new car and seeing a new refrigerator .
Ses01F_script01_3_M035 i mean . . .you can t take those things out of a war . when you drive that car and you see that new refrigerator you have to know that it came out of the love that a man can have for another man .
Ses01F_script01_3_M036 and i didn t want any of it . i guess that included you .
Ses01F_script01_3_M037 i just want you to know annie .
Ses01F_script01_3_M038 annie annie . i am going to make a fortune for you .
Ses01F_script03_1_F000 is it them ?
Ses01F_script03_1_F001 freda is the only one who knows we are here . she wouldn t ring up .
Ses01F_script03_1_F002 it had to happen sooner or later . what are we going to do ?
Ses01F_script03_1_F003 now and always sweet .
Ses01F_script03_1_F004 it had to happen sooner or later .
Ses01F_script03_1_F005  laughter that sent shivers up my spine .
Ses01F_script03_1_F006 we ll behave exquisitely .
Ses01F_script03_1_F007 i think i shall do a curtsy .
Ses01F_script03_1_F008 hmm . the pity is that one can t stay happy .
Ses01F_script03_1_F009 it s true . i think the whole thing s a cruel joke .
Ses01F_script03_1_F010 yes . meaning just that .
Ses01F_script03_1_F011 don t laugh at me . i m being serious .
Ses01F_script03_1_F012 who s they ?
Ses01F_script03_1_F013 you know if i laugh at everything then i must laugh at us too .
Ses01F_script03_1_F014 how long with it last this ludicrous overbearing love of ours ?
Ses01F_script03_1_F015 shall we always want to bicker and fight ?
Ses01F_script03_1_F016 oh dear should we like that ?
Ses01F_script03_1_F017 what happens if one of us dies ? does the other one still laugh ?
Ses01F_script03_1_F018 well that s serious enough isn t it ?
Ses01F_script03_1_F019 i think you are talking nonsense .
Ses01F_script03_1_F020  laughter 
Ses01F_script03_1_F021 oh elliott worms don t pop .
Ses01F_script03_1_F022 aw . thank you darling . the same applies to you too except that if you so much as look at another woman i ll kill you .

Ses01F_script03_1_F025 i know you did . you threw him out the window into the grand canal . i ll never forgive you for that .
Ses01F_script03_1_F026 it went on intermittently for days .
Ses01F_script03_1_F027 oh and it burnt my comb too and all of those towels in the bathroom .
Ses01F_script03_1_F028  laughter that was the first time you hit me .
Ses01F_script03_1_F029 the manager came in he found us rolling about the floor biting and scratching like panthers . laughter how utterly utterly ridiculous .
Ses01F_script03_1_F030  laughter and very much sillier .
Ses01F_script03_1_F031 oh . you knew there was nothing in that .
Ses01F_script03_1_M000 good god .
Ses01F_script03_1_M001 i wonder .

Ses01F_script03_1_M009 with perfect poise .
Ses01F_script03_1_M010 it s strange things that ought to matter dreadfully they just don t matter at all when one s happy . do they ?
Ses01F_script03_1_M011 darling don t say that .
Ses01F_script03_1_M012 what ? this beautiful and sacred thing love ?
Ses01F_script03_1_M013 well what does it all mean ? that s what i ask myself in my quest for ultimate truth . dear god what does it all mean ?
Ses01F_script03_1_M014 oh darling you mustn t be serious . it s just what they want .
Ses01F_script03_1_M015 all of those futile moralists who make life unbearable . you have to laugh at them be flippant .
Ses01F_script03_1_M016 you know flippancy brings out the acid in their darned light and sweetness .
Ses01F_script03_1_M017 oh of course . we are figures of fun . all right .
Ses01F_script03_1_M018 who knows ?
Ses01F_script03_1_M019 oh no . that fire will fade along with our passion .
Ses01F_script03_1_M020 well it depends on how well we ve played .
Ses01F_script03_1_M021 yes . yes with all of his might .
Ses01F_script03_1_M022 no no no no . no . death is a very laughable thing . it s a cunning little mystery it s all done with mirrors .
Ses01F_script03_1_M023 oh . so is everyone in the long run .
Ses01F_script03_1_M024 let s be superficial and just pity those poor philosophers huh ? let s blow trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party for as long as we can you know like small idiotic school children .
Ses01F_script03_1_M025 oh come and kiss me darling before your body rots and worms pop out of your eye sockets .
Ses01F_script03_1_M026 oh see i don t care what you do see . you can paint yourself green and run naked through the place vendome and run off with all of the men of the world . i shan t say a word just as long as you love me best .

Ses01F_script03_1_M031 how long did that row last ?
Ses01F_script03_1_M032 uh huh .
Ses01F_script03_1_M033 but the worst one was in cannes when your curling irons burnt a hole in my new dressing gown .

Ses01F_script01_1_F001 maybe we should tell him before he sees it .
Ses01F_script01_1_F002 how could he see it ? i was the first one up he was still in bed .

Ses01F_script01_1_F008 what do you mean dishonest ?
Ses01F_script01_1_F009 what do you want to do ? argue with him ?
Ses01F_script01_1_F010 you can t say that to him .
Ses01F_script01_1_F011 where s the proof ? do you have any proof ?
Ses01F_script01_1_F012 to you it is to me it is but to your father you can talk yourself until you are blue in the face . but there is no grave and there is no body so where are you ?
Ses01F_script01_1_F013 it s that the trouble is those god damn newspapers . every month some new boy comes back and so the next one is going to be larry they just 
Ses01F_script01_1_F014 why ?
Ses01F_script01_1_F015 well i got an idea but what s your story ?
Ses01F_script01_1_F016 well that s only your business chris .
Ses01F_script01_1_F017 well what do you want me to do ? you re old enough to know your own mind .
Ses01F_script01_1_F018 well you want to make sure that your father is not going to 
Ses01F_script01_1_F019 i m just saying .
Ses01F_script01_1_F020 oh . i ignore what i got to ignore . that girl is larry s girl .
Ses01F_script01_1_F021 from your father s point of view he is not dead and chris he still thinks he s still alive . the girl is larry s girl .
Ses01F_script01_1_F022 now you can go on from there if you know where to go but i m telling you i don t know where to go .
Ses01F_script01_1_F023 you re a considerate fellow there s nothing wrong in that .
Ses01F_script01_1_F024 i just don t see why . have you asked annie yet ?
Ses01F_script01_1_F025 well how do you know she s going to marry you ? maybe she feels the same way your father does .
Ses01F_script01_1_F026 the trouble is you don t see enough women . you never did .
Ses01F_script01_1_F027 why does it have to be annie ?
Ses01F_script01_1_F028 oh that s a great reason . it s no reason at all .
Ses01F_script01_1_F029 you haven t seen her since you went away to war it s been five years .
Ses01F_script01_1_F030 i don t want a diagram .
Ses01F_script01_1_F031 he thinks he s coming back chris .
Ses01F_script01_1_F032 you marry that girl you are pronouncing him dead . . .
Ses01F_script01_1_F033  . . .and then what s that going to do to your father ? do you know ? i don t .
Ses01F_script01_1_F034 just give it some more thought .
Ses01F_script01_1_F035 what the hell is this ?
Ses01F_script01_1_F036 are you crazy ?
Ses01F_script01_1_F037 you have a business here . what the hell is this ?
Ses01F_script01_1_F038 oh . must you be inspired ?
Ses01F_script01_1_F039 you mean to tell me that you would leave the business over this ?
Ses01F_script01_1_F040 well you don t want to think like that .
Ses01F_script01_1_F041 all right . but you don t want to think like that because what the hell are we working for chris ? it s all for you . this whole shooting match is for you .
Ses01F_script01_1_F042 just don t think like that .
Ses01F_script01_1_F043 i don t understand you do i ?
Ses01F_script01_1_F044 i can see that .
Ses01F_script01_1_M000 he saw it .
Ses01F_script01_1_M001 he was out here when it broke .
Ses01F_script01_1_M002 four o clock this morning . i heard a crack and i woke up and looked out . he was standing right over there when it cracked .
Ses01F_script01_1_M003 i don t know .
Ses01F_script01_1_M004 i guess he is .
Ses01F_script01_1_M005 i don t know the meaning of it . but i know one thing mom you ve made a terrible mistake with father .
Ses01F_script01_1_M006 being dishonest with him you know . this kind of thing always pays off and it s paying off .
Ses01F_script01_1_M007 you know larry is not coming back and i know it . why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him ?
Ses01F_script01_1_M008 i don t want to argue but it s time he realized that nobody believes larry is alive .
Ses01F_script01_1_M009 you know ? why shouldn t he walk the nights thinking of him dreaming of him ? do we contradict him ? do we say we don t have any hope anymore ? that we haven t had any hope for years now ?
Ses01F_script01_1_M010 we ve got to say it to him .
Ses01F_script01_1_M011 for god s sake three years ? nobody comes back after three years that s insane .
Ses01F_script01_1_M012 sit down mom . i want to talk to you .
Ses01F_script01_1_M013 all right all right all right . you know why i asked annie here right ?
Ses01F_script01_1_M014 you know .
Ses01F_script01_1_M015 i m going to ask her to marry me .
Ses01F_script01_1_M016 you know it s not just my business .
Ses01F_script01_1_M017 so all right then i ll just go ahead with it ?
Ses01F_script01_1_M018 then it s not just my business .
Ses01F_script01_1_M019 you know sometimes you infuriate me . you know that ? isn t it your business if i tell father and he throws a fit about it ? god you have such a talent for ignoring things .
Ses01F_script01_1_M020 she s not larry s girl .
Ses01F_script01_1_M021 i don t know why it is but every time i reach out for something i have to pull back because i am afraid other people will suffer . my whole bloody life time after time .
Ses01F_script01_1_M022 to hell with that .
Ses01F_script01_1_M023 i wanted to get this settled first .
Ses01F_script01_1_M024 well if she does then that s it . that s the end of it . from her letters though i think she s pretty much forgotten him .
Ses01F_script01_1_M025 and then we ll thrash it out with father . okay mom ? don t avoid me .
Ses01F_script01_1_M026 so what . i m not fast with women .
Ses01F_script01_1_M027 because it is .
Ses01F_script01_1_M028 i don t know .
Ses01F_script01_1_M029 i can t help it i know her best . i was brought up next door to her you know ? these years when i think of someone for my wife i think of annie .
Ses01F_script01_1_M030 mom what do you want ? a diagram ?
Ses01F_script01_1_M031 all right then mom . breathing 
Ses01F_script01_1_M032 i ve given it three years of thought . and i d hope that if i waited father would forget about larry and then we could just have a regular wedding and everyone would be happy .
Ses01F_script01_1_M033 but if i can t do that here i may have to go somewhere else .
Ses01F_script01_1_M034 i ll get out . i ll get married and i ll move somewhere else maybe new york .
Ses01F_script01_1_M035 i ve been a good son for too long a good sucker .
Ses01F_script01_1_M036 the business ? the business doesn t inspire me .
Ses01F_script01_1_M037 yes . i like it for an hour a day . i don t care if i have to grub for money all day long when i come home i want it happy .
Ses01F_script01_1_M038 i want some kids i want a family i want somebody that i can give myself to and annie is in the center of that . now it s just where to find it .

Ses01F_impro06_F007 so i was like wandering around before . it takes forever to find her headstone i always lose it . you know .
Ses01F_impro06_F008 so i was looking at this other one and there was like a piece of candy there and i thought that i would take the candy and put it on her headstone . and 
Ses01F_impro06_F009 this woman came up and you know it was hers . it was her person that was there .
Ses01F_impro06_F010 yeah . and she was like that s pathetic i hope you enjoy it .

Ses01F_impro06_F026 some i guess . she memorized this one john dunn it s called death be not proud . and 
Ses01F_impro06_F027 there s another one i can t remember .

Ses01M_script02_1_M016 oh yeah i m so excited right now i m like a kid .
Ses01M_script02_1_M017 i can t believe i got out of the house without my fly zipped up even .
Ses01M_script02_1_M018 i wonder if they can hear me talking you know .
Ses01M_script02_1_M019 like feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around .
Ses01M_script02_1_M020 do you want my jacket ?
Ses01M_script02_1_M021 what are you kidding ? we just got here . we don t want to turn around and go home now . what s the point coming all the way down here ?
Ses01M_script02_1_M022 right .
Ses01M_script02_1_M023 that s my point too .
Ses01M_script02_1_M024 no wait no no that s not my point . my point is there is no point and coming all the way down here if we just turn around and go home .
Ses01M_script02_1_M025 don t you want to see it ?
Ses01M_script02_1_M026 why not ?
Ses01M_script02_1_M027 it s not stupid . it s a natural phenomenon .
Ses01M_script02_1_M028 people in kansas would have to get plane tickets and make hotel reservations to see this . it s only forty minutes away it s just too good to pass up .
Ses01M_script02_1_M029 yeah but that like flopping around is what to do it s like spawning or mating or something . this is like the highlight of their little fish lives . it s like life s last orgy .
Ses01M_script02_1_M030 yeah they do .
Ses01M_script02_1_M031 well okay whatever okay but it s a fish who do something that like no other fish do you know it s like those swallows that return to capistrano or those like those lemmings that jumped off the cliffs you know .
Ses01M_script02_1_M032 it s like a little bit of the unexplainable a little magic a little mystery . i just don t see how you can not be interested in this .
Ses01M_script02_1_M033 for real ?
Ses01M_script02_1_M034 all right .
Ses01M_script02_1_M035 i don t get it though i mean the first time we came here you said it was like the best night of your life . . .
Ses01M_script02_1_M036 and last year i remember like distinctively you were so excited to get here that you didn t realize you stubbed your toe until we were in a car .
Ses01M_script02_1_M037 we just weren t in a good spot though .
Ses01M_script02_1_M038 we just weren t in a good spot i m telling you this is a much better spot .
Ses01M_script02_1_M039 come on trust me i got instincts for these things okay ? so just just think about it all right ? okay i know you re not interested think about it . . .
Ses01M_script02_1_M040 out there there s like this big mass of silver fish they re heading this way . . .
Ses01M_script02_1_M041 they don t know why we don t know why . no one like sent them an invitation or gave them a map or direction . . .
Ses01M_script02_1_M042 they just all turned at once and they just form this line as long as the california coast . and they just started swimming . . .
Ses01M_script02_1_M043 like some little time release fire cracker went off inside their little tiny bodies . and they all turned as one . . .
Ses01M_script02_1_M044 and form the line and started swimming swimming that would bring them to this point here . . .
Ses01M_script02_1_M045 it s like urgency that s pure urge you know . it s single mindedness with no mind .
Ses01M_script02_1_M046 it s crazy . look at this i m giving myself goose bumps the hairs are standing up on my arm .
Ses01M_script01_1_F000 what he s going to say ?
Ses01M_script01_1_F001 when ?
Ses01M_script01_1_F002 how could he see it ? i was the first one up and he was still in bed .
Ses01M_script01_1_F003 what was he doing here at four in the morning ?
Ses01M_script01_1_F004 did you talk to him ?
Ses01M_script01_1_F005 cried hard ?
Ses01M_script01_1_F006  breathing 
Ses01M_script01_1_F007 what is he doing out here at that hour ?
Ses01M_script01_1_F008 he s dreaming about him again walking the streets .
Ses01M_script01_1_F009 it s getting to be just like after he died . what is the meaning of that ?
Ses01M_script01_1_F010 what ?
Ses01M_script01_1_F011 what do you mean a mistake ?
Ses01M_script01_1_F012 what do you want to do argue with him ?
Ses01M_script01_1_F013 you can t say that to him .
Ses01M_script01_1_F014 what can you prove it ? what proof do you have ? can you prove it ?
Ses01M_script01_1_F015 to you it is to me it is . but to your father ? you can talk yourself til you re blue in the face but there s was no grave and there is no body . so where are you ?
Ses01M_script01_1_F016 the trouble is those god damn news papers . every month some boy comes back missing longer then larry so 
Ses01M_script01_1_F017 why ?
Ses01M_script01_1_F018 well i ve got an idea but what s the story ?
Ses01M_script01_1_F019 well that s only your business chris .
Ses01M_script01_1_F020 well what do you want me to do ? you re old enough known your own business .
Ses01M_script01_1_F021 you want to make sure that your father s not going to . . .
Ses01M_script01_1_F022 i m just saying .
Ses01M_script01_1_F023 i m sorry . i ignore what i ve got to ignore . that girl is larry s girl .
Ses01M_script01_1_F024 from father s point of view he is not dead and you have no right to take his girl . i m just saying that you can go on from there if you know where to go but i m saying i don t know where to go . see i don t know .
Ses01M_script01_1_F025 you re a considerate fellow . there s nothing wrong in that .
Ses01M_script01_1_F026 did you ask annie yet ?
Ses01M_script01_1_F027 well how do you know she s going to marry you ? maybe she feels same way your father does .
Ses01M_script01_1_F028 the trouble is you don t see enough women you never did .
Ses01M_script01_1_F029 i don t see why it has to be annie .
Ses01M_script01_1_F030 that s a good answer but it doesn t answer anything . you haven t seen her since you went away to war it s been five years .
Ses01M_script01_1_F031 he thinks he s coming back chris . you marry that girl you re pronouncing him dead .
Ses01M_script01_1_F032 do you know what that ll do to you to your father do you know ? i don t .
Ses01M_script01_1_F033 give it some more thought .
Ses01M_script01_1_F034 what the hell is this ?
Ses01M_script01_1_F035 are you crazy ?
Ses01M_script01_1_F036 you have a business here . i said what the hell is this ?
Ses01M_script01_1_F037 oh must you be inspired .
Ses01M_script01_1_F038 you mean to tell me you would leave the business for this .
Ses01M_script01_1_F039 well you don t want to think like that .
Ses01M_script01_1_F040 all right but you don t think like that because what the hell is this all for . this is all for you what are we working for chris ? the whole shooting match is for you .
Ses01M_script01_1_F041 well you don t think like that .
Ses01M_script01_1_F042 i don t understand you do i ?
Ses01M_script01_1_F043 well i can see that .
Ses01M_script01_1_M000 he saw it .
Ses01M_script01_1_M001 he was out here at four this morning .
Ses01M_script01_1_M002 i was out here at four this morning i heard a crack and i looked out the window and he was standing right over there .
Ses01M_script01_1_M003 i don t know . but he went back in the kitchen and he cried .
Ses01M_script01_1_M004 no . i figured i d just let it wait .
Ses01M_script01_1_M005 yeah i could hear him crying through the floorboards in my room .
Ses01M_script01_1_M006 i don t know .
Ses01M_script01_1_M007 i guess he is .
Ses01M_script01_1_M008 i don t know the meaning of it . but i know we ve made terrible mistake with father .
Ses01M_script01_1_M009 i mean these kinds of things man they always come back at you . and this is definitely coming back to us .
Ses01M_script01_1_M010 i just why shouldn t he walk the nights waiting for him huh ? do we contradict him do we say we don t have any hope any more that he s not coming back ?
Ses01M_script01_1_M011 i don t want to argue with him it s just for god s sake it s time he realized that no one believes with him any more .
Ses01M_script01_1_M012 i got to .
Ses01M_script01_1_M013 for god s sake three years ? nobody comes back after three years . it s insane .
Ses01M_script01_1_M014 okay all right . mom sit down . i want to talk to you .
Ses01M_script01_1_M015 yeah okay all right all right . listen um you know why i asked annie here right ?
Ses01M_script01_1_M016 you know .
Ses01M_script01_1_M017 i m going to ask her to marry me .
Ses01M_script01_1_M018 you know it s not just my business .
Ses01M_script01_1_M019 so it s okay then ? i m just going to go ahead with it ?
Ses01M_script01_1_M020 see . then it s not just my business . sometimes you infuriate me you know that ? you know it s just your business too if i tell father and he throws a fit about it huh ?
Ses01M_script01_1_M021 she is not larry s girl .
Ses01M_script01_1_M022 i don t know why it is you know every time i reach out for something i have to pull back cause i m afraid it s going to hurt somebody . all my life . . .
Ses01M_script01_1_M023 to hell with that .
Ses01M_script01_1_M024 no i wanted to get this all sorted out first .
Ses01M_script01_1_M025 well if she does then that s the end of it . however from her letters i think she s pretty much forgotten him .
Ses01M_script01_1_M026 so what ? i m just i m not fast with women .
Ses01M_script01_1_M027 because it is .
Ses01M_script01_1_M028 i don t know it i think of her i grew up next to her . she is what i think of when i think of a wife .
Ses01M_script01_1_M029 all right then .
Ses01M_script01_1_M030 i ve given it lots of thought . and i keep coming back to the same thing .
Ses01M_script01_1_M031 when i think of a family when i think of my future i see annie in the center of that and you know and if that can t happen here then i ll go somewhere else .
Ses01M_script01_1_M032 i ll leave . i ll get married and move somewhere else maybe new york .
Ses01M_script01_1_M033 i ll do it .
Ses01M_script01_1_M034 business ? the business doesn t inspire me .
Ses01M_script01_1_M035 yes yes i like it for one hour a day . i don t care if i have to grub for money all day long when i come home i want it nice i want a family i want to kids and annie is in the center of that .
Ses01M_script01_1_M036 if that can t happen here . . .
Ses01M_script01_1_M037 yes on this i would .
Ses01M_script01_1_M038 then help me stay here mom .
Ses01M_script01_1_M039 i know i know .
Ses01M_script01_1_M040 then help me stay .
Ses01M_script01_1_M041 i am thinking like that .
Ses01M_script01_1_M042 no you don t . i m a pretty tough guy .
Ses02M_script01_3_F000 you re the only one i know who loves his parents .
Ses02M_script01_3_F001 it s all right . it s a good thing .
Ses02M_script01_3_F002 you know it s lovely here the air is sweet .
Ses02M_script01_3_F003 no not sorry . but um . but i m not gonna stay .
Ses02M_script01_3_F004 for one thing your mother as much as told me to go .
Ses02M_script01_3_F005 you saw that . i mean and then well you ve been kind of um 
Ses02M_script01_3_F006 well kind of embarrassed ever since i got here .
Ses02M_script01_3_F007 i knew they would your mother anyway .
Ses02M_script01_3_F008 well from her point of view why else would i come ?
Ses02M_script01_3_F009 i guess this is why i came .
Ses02M_script01_3_F010 oh chris i ve been ready for a long long time .
Ses02M_script01_3_F011 i almost got married two years ago .
Ses02M_script01_3_F012 well you started to write me
Ses02M_script01_3_F013 every day since .
Ses02M_script01_3_F014 well i was waiting for you . i mean till then you never wrote and when you did what did you say ? i mean you can sure be ambiguous sometimes you know ?
Ses02M_script01_3_F015 i ll never forgive you . why did you wait all these years ? i mean all i did was sit and wonder if i was crazy for thinking of you .
Ses02M_script01_3_F016 not like that you re not .
Ses02M_script01_3_F017 like larry s brother . do it like you chris . what is it ?
Ses02M_script01_3_F018 no . what is it chris . your mother ?
Ses02M_script01_3_F019 well what s wrong ? i mean even in your letters there was some something ashamed .
Ses02M_script01_3_F020 you ve gotta tell me .
Ses02M_script01_3_F021 it wouldn t work this way .
Ses02M_script01_3_F022 yeah sure .
Ses02M_script01_3_F023 how many ?
Ses02M_script01_3_F024 gee .
Ses02M_script01_3_F025 do you still feel that way ?
Ses02M_script01_3_F026  cause you mustn t feel that way . because you have a right to everything you have chris . everything you understand that ? me too .
Ses02M_script01_3_F027 i mean and your money there s there s nothing wrong with your money . i mean your father put hundreds of planes in the air . a man should be paid for that .
Ses02M_script01_3_F028 what ll i do with a fortune ?
Ses02M_script01_3_M000 i know it went out of style didn t it ?
Ses02M_script01_3_M001 you re not sorry you came ?
Ses02M_script01_3_M002 why ?
Ses02M_script01_3_M003 oh .
Ses02M_script01_3_M004 what ?
Ses02M_script01_3_M005 the trouble is i planned on sort of sneaking up on you on a period of a week or so . but they take it for granted that we re all set .
Ses02M_script01_3_M006 how d you know ?
Ses02M_script01_3_M007 oh . would you want to ? i guess you know this is why i asked you to come .
Ses02M_script01_3_M008 ann i love you . i love you a great deal . i love you .
Ses02M_script01_3_M009 i have no imagination . that s all i know to tell you .
Ses02M_script01_3_M010 i m embarrassing you and i didn t want to tell it to you here . i wanted some place we d never been before . a place where we d be brand new to each other .
Ses02M_script01_3_M011 you feel wrong here don t you ? this yard this chair . i want you to be ready for me . i don t want to have to win you away from anything .
Ses02M_script01_3_M012 and he s gone forever . you re sure ?
Ses02M_script01_3_M013 why didn t you ?
Ses02M_script01_3_M014 you felt something that far back ?
Ses02M_script01_3_M015 ann why didn t you let me know ?
Ses02M_script01_3_M016 give me a kiss anne . give me a 
Ses02M_script01_3_M017 god i kissed annie . how long how long i ve been waiting to kiss you .
Ses02M_script01_3_M018 oh annie we re gonna live now . i m gonna make you so happy .
Ses02M_script01_3_M019 i kissed you .
Ses02M_script01_3_M020 let s drive someplace . i want to be alone with you .
Ses02M_script01_3_M021 no . nothing like that .
Ses02M_script01_3_M022 yeah i suppose i have been . but it s going from me .
Ses02M_script01_3_M023 i don t know how to start .
Ses02M_script01_3_M024 it s all mixed up with so many other things . you remember overseas i was in charge of a company ?
Ses02M_script01_3_M025 well i lost them .
Ses02M_script01_3_M026 just about all .
Ses02M_script01_3_M027 it takes some time for a guy to toss that off . cause they weren t just men .
Ses02M_script01_3_M028 for instance this one time it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks . i put them in pocket . it s only a little thing but those are the kind of guys i had .
Ses02M_script01_3_M029 they didn t die they killed themselves for each other . i mean that exactly . i mean a little more selfish and they d have been here today .
Ses02M_script01_3_M030 i got this idea watching em go down . everything was being destroyed see but it seemed that one new thing was made . a sort of responsibility . man for man . you know what i mean ?
Ses02M_script01_3_M031 to show that to bring that onto the earth again like some kind of monument and everyone can feel it standing behind him and it would make a difference to him .
Ses02M_script01_3_M032 then i came back and it was incredible . there was no meaning in it here . i mean the whole thing to them seemed like it s sort of a bus accident . i went to work with dad and that rat race again .
Ses02M_script01_3_M033 and i felt what you said ashamed somehow cause nobody had changed at all . it seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys . i felt wrong to be alive to open the new bank book drive the new car see the new refrigerator .
Ses02M_script01_3_M034 i mean you can take those things out of a war but when you drive that car you ve gotta realize that it came out of the love a man can have for a man . you ve gotta be a little better because of it .
Ses02M_script01_3_M035 otherwise all you have is really loot and there s blood on it . and i didn t want to take any of that . and i guess that included you .
Ses02M_script01_3_M036 i want you now annie .
Ses02M_script01_3_M037 i know annie . i m gonna make a fortune for you .
Ses02M_script01_1_F000 what s he going to say maybe we ought to tell him before he sees it .
Ses02M_script01_1_F001 how could he see it ? i was the first one up he was still in bed .
Ses02M_script01_1_F002 when ?
Ses02M_script01_1_F003 what was he doing out here at four in the morning ?
Ses02M_script01_1_F004 so you talked to him ?
Ses02M_script01_1_F005 he cried hard ?
Ses02M_script01_1_F006 what was he doing out here at that hour ? he s dreaming about him again he s walking around at night .
Ses02M_script01_1_F007 he s getting just like after he died . what is the meaning of that ?
Ses02M_script01_1_F008 what ?
Ses02M_script01_1_F009 what do you mean dishonest ?
Ses02M_script01_1_F010 what do you want to do argue with him ?
Ses02M_script01_1_F011 you can t say that to him .
Ses02M_script01_1_F012 can you prove it how can you prove it ?
Ses02M_script01_1_F013 to you it is and to me . you can talk yourself blue in the face but there is no body and no grave so where are you ?
Ses02M_script01_1_F014 the trouble is the god damned newspapers every month or so a boy turns up out of nowhere so the next one is going to be larry .
Ses02M_script01_1_F015 i got an idea but what s the story ?
Ses02M_script01_1_F016 well that s only your business chris .
Ses02M_script01_1_F017 what do you want me to do you re old enough to know your own mind .
Ses02M_script01_1_F018 well you want to make sure that your father isn t 
Ses02M_script01_1_F019 i m just saying
Ses02M_script01_1_F020 i ignore what i got to ignore . the girl is larry s girl .
Ses02M_script01_1_F021 from father s point of you he isn t dead and you have no right to take his girl .
Ses02M_script01_1_F022 you can go on from there if you know where to go but i don t know where to go see i don t know . so what can i do for you ?
Ses02M_script01_1_F023 you re a considerate fellow . there s nothing wrong with that .
Ses02M_script01_1_F024 have you asked annie yet ?
Ses02M_script01_1_F025 how do you know she ll marry you ? maybe she feels the same way your father does .
Ses02M_script01_1_F026 trouble is you don t see enough women you never did .
Ses02M_script01_1_F027 i just don t see why it has to be annie .
Ses02M_script01_1_F028 that s a good answer but it doesn t answer anything . i mean you haven t seen her since you went away to war it s five years .
Ses02M_script01_1_F029 i don t want a diagram . he thinks he s coming back . chris you marry this girl you re pronouncing him dead .
Ses02M_script01_1_F030 do you know what s going to happen to your father because i don t see ?
Ses02M_script01_1_F031 just give it some more thought .
Ses02M_script01_1_F032 what the hell is this ?
Ses02M_script01_1_F033 what the hell is this are you crazy ?
Ses02M_script01_1_F034 what about the business ? what is this ?
Ses02M_script01_1_F035 must you be inspired ?
Ses02M_script01_1_F036 tell me you d leave the business ?
Ses02M_script01_1_F037 well you don t want to think like that .
Ses02M_script01_1_F038 all right . but you don t want to be thinking like that cause otherwise what did we work for i mean the whole thing is for you chris the whole shooting match is for you .
Ses02M_script01_1_F039 just don t go thinking that way .
Ses02M_script01_1_F040 i don t understand you do i ?
Ses02M_script01_1_F041 yea i can see that .
Ses02M_script01_1_M000 he saw it .
Ses02M_script01_1_M001 he was out here when it broke .
Ses02M_script01_1_M002 about four this morning . i heard it cracking and i woke up and looked out . he was standing right here when it cracked .
Ses02M_script01_1_M003 i don t know . when it cracked he ran into the house and cried in the kitchen .
Ses02M_script01_1_M004 no . i figured it was best to leave him alone .
Ses02M_script01_1_M005 i could hear him right through the floor in my room .
Ses02M_script01_1_M006 i guess he is .
Ses02M_script01_1_M007 i don t know the meaning of it but i know one thing mom we ve made a terrible mistake with dad .
Ses02M_script01_1_M008 being dishonest with him . i mean that sort of thing always pays off and now it s paying off .
Ses02M_script01_1_M009 you know that larry is not coming back and i know it . why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him ?
Ses02M_script01_1_M010 no i don t want to argue with him but it s about time he realized that nobody believes larry is alive anymore .
Ses02M_script01_1_M011 why why shouldn t he dream of him ? walk around waiting for him at night i mean do we contradict him do we say straight out that we don t have any hope anymore that we haven t had hope for years now ?
Ses02M_script01_1_M012 we ve got to say it to him .
Ses02M_script01_1_M013 for god sakes it s been three years nobody comes back after three years that s insane .
Ses02M_script01_1_M014 sit down mom i want to talk to you .
Ses02M_script01_1_M015 all right . all right . listen to me .
Ses02M_script01_1_M016 you know why i brought annie here don t you ?

Ses02M_script01_1_M021 see it isn t just my business 
Ses02M_script01_1_M022 sometimes you infuriate me you know that . isn t it your business to if i tell dad and he throws a fit about it ? you have such a talent for ignoring things .
Ses02M_script01_1_M023 she s not larry s girl .
Ses02M_script01_1_M024 i don t know why but every time i reach out for something that i really want i have to pull back cause someone else will suffer . my whole bloody life time after time after time .
Ses02M_script01_1_M025 to hell with that .
Ses02M_script01_1_M026 i wanted to get this settled first .
Ses02M_script01_1_M027 well if she does then that s the end of it . from her letters i think she s forgotten him .
Ses02M_script01_1_M028 i don t know i ll find out . then we ll trash it out with dad right ? mom don t avoid me .
Ses02M_script01_1_M029 so what i m not fast with women .

Ses02M_script01_1_M033 all right . all right . mom .
Ses02M_script01_1_M034 i ve given it three years of thought . i thought that if i waited dad would forget about larry and we could have a regular wedding and everything happy .
Ses02M_script01_1_M035 if i can t do that here well then i ll have to get out .
Ses02M_script01_1_M036 i ll get out . i ll get married and go live some place else maybe new york .

Ses02F_script03_1_F024 yes i know you did . you threw it out of the window into the grand canal . i don t think i ll ever forgive you for that .
Ses02F_script03_1_F025 it went in intermittently for days .
Ses02F_script03_1_F026 it burned my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom .
Ses02F_script03_1_F027 that was the first time you ever hit me .
Ses02F_script03_1_F028 the manager came in and found us rolling around on the floor biting and scratching like panthers .
Ses02F_script03_1_F029 it was ridiculous . completely ridiculous .
Ses02F_script03_1_F030 and very much sillier .
Ses02F_script03_1_M000 good god .
Ses02F_script03_1_M001 i wonder .

Ses02F_script03_1_M006 what do we do if they suddenly walk in on us ?
Ses02F_script03_1_M007 with the most perfect poise ?
Ses02F_script03_1_M008 things that ought to matter dreadfully don t matter at all when one s happy . do they ?
Ses02F_script03_1_M009 oh darling don t say that .
Ses02F_script03_1_M010 meaning that sacred and beautiful thing love ?

Ses02F_script03_1_M012 you mustn t be serious my dear one . that s just what they want .
Ses02F_script03_1_M013 all those futile moralists that try to make life unbearable . laugh at them . be flippant . laugh at everything . all their sacred shibboleths .
Ses02F_script03_1_M014 flippancy brings out the acid in their damn sweetness and light .
Ses02F_script03_1_M015 certainly you must . we re figures of fun alright .
Ses02F_script03_1_M016 who knows .
Ses02F_script03_1_M017 no that desire will fade . along with our passion .
Ses02F_script03_1_M018 depends on how well we ve played .
Ses02F_script03_1_M019 yes . yes . with all his might .
Ses02F_script03_1_M020 no . no it isn t . death is very laughable . such a cunning little mystery . all done with mirrors .
Ses02F_script03_1_M021 so is everyone else in the long run .
Ses02F_script03_1_M022 let s be superficial and pity the poor philosophers . let s blow our trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as much as we can . like quite idiotic very small school children . let s savor the delight of the moment .
Ses02F_script03_1_M023 come and kiss me darling before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets .
Ses02F_script03_1_M024 i don t care what you do . see you could paint yourself green and dance naked in the place vendome and rush off madly with all the men in the world and i shan t say a word . as long as you love me best .
Ses02F_script03_1_M025 you remember that awful scene we had in venice ?
Ses02F_script03_1_M026 the one when you bought that little painted wooden snake in the piazza and put it on my bed .
Ses02F_script03_1_M027 ah horrible thing . i hated it .
Ses02F_script03_1_M028 how long did that row last ?
Ses02F_script03_1_M029 the worst one was in cannes when your curling iron burnt a hole in my new dressing gown .
Ses02F_script03_1_M030 that was a rouser wasn t it ?
Ses02F_script03_1_M031 i didn t hit you very hard .
Ses02F_script03_1_M032 oh i ll never forget his face .
Ses02F_script03_1_M033 we were very much younger then .
Ses02F_script03_1_M034 as a matter of fact the real cause of that row was peter burden .

Ses02M_impro03_M011 so i i talked to some of the crew before hand and 
Ses02M_impro03_M012 i i did .
Ses02M_impro03_M013 so i got the band to do something you know like towards the end of the song i got to go up on stage and uh
Ses02M_impro03_M014 i know so
Ses02M_impro03_M015 i got to freak her out .
Ses02M_impro03_M016 no yes so
Ses02M_impro03_M017 yea that way she was guaranteed that she could not say no .
Ses02M_impro03_M018 no but it was good .
Ses02M_impro03_M019 yes yes . laughter 
Ses02M_impro03_M020 i know it was i don t know i was really nervous but i m really i m really glad .
Ses02M_impro03_M021 oh yes they they you know they love her and so i mean . . .
Ses02M_impro03_M022 well we re thinking uh we re thinking winter time you know we re going to do it in the winter and then maybe you know maybe
Ses02M_impro03_M023 i don t know either do a honeymoon like in the snow or fly down to like australia southern hemisphere garbage so we ll decide with that .
Ses02M_impro03_M024 yea yea i m not too sure where yet i guess you know i kind of got to figure some stuff out here first
Ses02M_impro03_M025 but like you know it s just i guess we re just excited right now that we ll get to continue it together .
Ses02M_impro03_M026 i know .
Ses02M_impro03_M027 oh it will obviously you know . but i know it s something i don t know you never really think about it happening like before hand .
Ses02M_impro03_M028 sure . oh yes .
Ses02M_impro03_M029 you know i had my mom come along maybe help me out a little bit because she s got good taste . but
Ses02M_impro03_M030 yes well thanks thanks . thank you . yeah
Ses02M_impro03_M031 hah .
Ses02M_impro04_F000 so how you feeling ?
Ses02M_impro04_F001 you ve been doing a lot of work for it right ?
Ses02M_impro04_F002 right so the fact you doing the best that you can is 
Ses02M_impro04_F003 you know you shouldn t give yourself a hard time for that it s the best you can .
Ses02M_impro04_F004 well but you care about what you do right ?
Ses02M_impro04_F005 i understand that it s so frustrating but i know that you re here because you really want it you know and and uh
Ses02M_impro04_F006 well i mean you re still here you ve tried for this long so i think that says something all in itself .
Ses02M_impro04_F007 you are persistence . i mean that s important . that s
Ses02M_impro04_F008 well you re talented so keep that in mind you know you shouldn t give yourself too hard of a time .
Ses02M_impro04_F009 i m sorry .
Ses02M_impro04_F010 that s i mean . there are more factors then just whether you re good or not you know what i mean like
Ses02M_impro04_F011 and the fact that you know there is always different types of things and what kind of people they want in the office and whether it s male or female or you know what i mean like things are out of your control .
Ses02M_impro04_F012 so you should take that in consideration rather than giving yourself such a hard time .
Ses02M_impro04_F013 it might be the latter i don t know because you re not the worst i mean you re great you very talented at what you do .
Ses02M_impro04_F014 you know and the fact you still here and still cooking like it s good that you re thinking about it that you re reconsidering .
Ses02M_impro04_F015 but like just because you re considering why it s been so difficult doesn t mean you should just stop .
Ses02M_impro04_F016 maybe you should take a little break from it but i don t think you should stop .
Ses02M_impro04_F017 get out of town or something i mean you need you need to clear your head cause you seem like you re really frustrated about it . i mean you need to like be excited about you re doing rather than you know upset .
Ses02M_impro04_M000 uhm i don t know
Ses02M_impro04_M001 i don t know what i m going to do about this i mean
Ses02M_impro04_M002 i have got to get a job you know ? like 
Ses02M_impro04_M003 well yea you know i get my resumes and i mean i 
Ses02M_impro04_M004 i go out all the places i can every place that ll give an interview you know .
Ses02M_impro04_M005 but it s been so long like what what am i what am i waiting i should probably just do something else or
Ses02M_impro04_M006 i don t know i mean why why
Ses02M_impro04_M007 yea but it s it s almost like it s not worth it you know if i m going to waste to have my life like trying to get a job i mean once i actually do get the job it s like oh retirement or something . i don t know you know .
Ses02M_impro04_M008 well and that s what i begin to question after a while is maybe i just don t want it maybe it s not even worth it you know like
Ses02M_impro04_M009 i don t even know if it s going to be worth it because i can t break myself in you know like i can t can t even get a foot in the door you know .
Ses02M_impro04_M010 yea it says i m stupid enough to be trying this long and not move on somewhere else .
Ses02M_impro04_M011 i mean i can t i can t be persistent forever you know you can t not have a job forever you know i ve got i ve got to do something i ve got to make money and get food on the table .
Ses02M_impro04_M012 i mean maybe i m not you know . i don t have a job . maybe maybe i m not as good as as i thought i was and
Ses02M_impro04_M013 i just got a whole skewed opinion on just how this is supposed to work out and
Ses02M_impro04_M014 i don t know it s just not i don t know i don t know what to do really you know i m just thinking
Ses02M_impro04_M015 maybe maybe take up painting i don t know you know .
Ses02M_impro04_M016 do something that i don t have to go out and do something stay at home i don t know .
Ses02M_impro04_M017 seems like the only option at this point because obviously the outer world has just rejected me of all possible employment .
Ses02M_impro04_M018 i know but i mean if that s the you know i m either like the worst at this or just the most unlucky person on the planet i mean this doesn t
Ses02M_impro04_M019 this doesn t happen to a normal person .
Ses02M_impro04_M020 i mean i don t know i don t see i don t see any other way any other way around it right now .
Ses02M_impro04_M021 what am i going to do on a break ?
Ses02M_impro04_M022 right . thanks for talking to me .
Ses02M_impro02_F000 i don t want you to go .
Ses02M_impro02_F001 i m going to miss you too i don t know what i m going to do here without you . it s going to be so lonely and so hard .
Ses02M_impro02_F002 i don t want to be a single mom .

Ses02M_impro02_F007 it s going to be really rough .
Ses02M_impro02_F008 i ll send you lots of pictures .
Ses02M_impro02_F009 well just promise me that you going to be safe .
Ses02M_impro02_F010 i mean can t they put you in like you know kitchen work or something where you won t get
Ses02M_impro02_F011 it doesn t make any sense i don t know why we have to be at war in the first place .

Ses02M_script02_2_F001 it s ridiculous .
Ses02M_script02_2_F002 it s pr . someone sold you a bill of goods that this wonderful event is going to take place on the beach .
Ses02M_script02_2_F003 yea sure everyone was sold the same story . i mean it keeps us all excited keeps us coming back for more keeps us thinking that life is going to start any second now if we can just get in on the action and find the right spot .
Ses02M_script02_2_F004 i m sorry but it s still just fish to me .
Ses02M_script02_2_F005 goddamn it augie don t ask me that . i hate it when you ask me that . you always ask me that . it s insulting .
Ses02M_script02_2_F006 we just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like .
Ses02M_script02_2_F007 for heavens sake we are not going to see the grunions .
Ses02M_script02_2_F008 we never do do we ? i mean have we ever ?
Ses02M_script02_2_F009 twice is every time we ve tried that s ever .
Ses02M_script02_2_F010 no we won t it s pointless . it s like waiting up to see santa claus 
Ses02M_script02_2_F011 i mean i feel like my whole life is going to be spent standing on the beach waiting for the fish to show up with my eyes open and my hands clasped expectantly and the fish won t show up .
Ses02M_script02_2_F012 you don t understand anything i m saying .
Ses02M_script02_2_F013 i did want to see them i always do . i mean i keep thinking that this is going to be the time and it never is .
Ses02M_script02_2_F014 for heavens sake this isn t about fish .
Ses02M_script02_2_F015 do you remember the first time we came to see it ? it was about four years ago right after we got married .
Ses02M_script02_2_F016 we thought i was pregnant and we opened a bottle of champagne but no glasses you asked me to dance we kicked off our shoes and you popped the cork .
Ses02M_script02_2_F017 and when we were dancing you said the softest most intimate things to me right into my ears so i could feel them as much as hear them
Ses02M_script02_2_F018 and i remember thinking that this is it you know . at last at last i am as happy as i am supposed to be
Ses02M_script02_2_F019 just dancing barefoot in the sand drinking champagne out of the bottle .
Ses02M_script02_2_F020 i d rather not remember some things . i would rather not hope for some things .
Ses02M_script02_2_F021 no .
Ses02M_script02_2_F022 no .
Ses02M_script02_2_F023 no .
Ses02M_script02_2_F024 no .
Ses02M_script02_2_F025 no .
Ses02M_script02_2_F026 no .
Ses02M_script02_2_F027 no .
Ses02M_script02_2_F028 i want something to turn out the way that it supposed to .
Ses02M_script02_2_F029 this ? what what is this ? this isn t even anything .
Ses02M_script02_2_F030 i m sure this is standing on the beach this is waiting this is fighting .
Ses02M_script02_2_F031 well but this isn t anything like i thought anything would be like .
Ses02M_script02_2_F032 i mean it s this is just this . i mean it includes a lot and everything but isn t something else . do you have any idea what i m trying to say ?
Ses02M_script02_2_F033 i know that augie . really i do .
Ses02M_script02_2_F034 i know that you meant this to be special and nice and there s the sand and the moon and everything but i just couldn t help thinking about being somewhere else .
Ses02M_script02_2_F035 i didn t say that .
Ses02M_script02_2_F036 for heavens sake whatever i m doing i d rather be doing it with you .
Ses02M_script02_2_F037 don t be ridiculous . i mean don t you know that ?
Ses02M_script02_2_F038 you re the one who probably wishes he was with someone else someone who knew how to enjoy herself and didn t take everything so hard .
Ses02M_script02_2_F039 okay . fine so we re in the wrong spot but we re with the right person .
Ses02M_script02_2_F040 yes i noticed that . it looks pretty on the water doesn t it ? big old white moon .
Ses02M_script02_2_F041 augie you brought refreshments .
Ses02M_script02_2_F042 well i guess we don t need glasses .
Ses02M_script02_2_F043 no . no . i think you might be right . i think this may be the spot after all .
Ses02M_script02_2_F044 augie i m sorry .
Ses02M_script02_2_F045 or not .
Ses02M_script02_2_F046 hmm .
Ses02M_script02_2_M000 so what do you think ?
Ses02M_script02_2_M001 what i was saying .

Ses02M_script02_2_M014 all right . i ve been trying to work this backwards but i cannot seem to pinpoint the moment that we took a turn for the worst .

Ses02M_script02_2_M031 no no just like you i thought it was going to be all like peaches and roses and sand in our toes and wind in our hair and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves and we ll have three fat rosy kids and ha ha baby the joke is on us

Ses02M_script02_2_M042 what have we got here ?
Ses02M_script02_2_M043 it s not champagne .
Ses02M_script02_2_M044 you still cold ? do you want my jacket ? do you want to go home ?
Ses02M_script02_2_M045 shh if we re very quiet the fish might come .
Ses02M_script02_2_M046 or not .
Ses02M_impro05_F000 hi can i help you ?
Ses02M_impro05_F001 oh did you check ? did you make sure as it went around the second time that it 
Ses02M_impro05_F002 okay . well um the f .
Ses02M_impro05_F003 actually i m looking here at the information the flight that you were on we had some trouble with some of the baggage it looks like a few peoples bags didn t make it through . um so 
Ses02M_impro05_F004 well you can fill out this paperwork um and if for some reason it shows up we can bring it to you but 
Ses02M_impro05_F005 well sometimes it s just late baggage or misplaced baggage and it comes out but it seems to be here and just i m reading off of this that
Ses02M_impro05_F006 uh it didn t make it into the second plane so it looks like there they don t actually know what happened to it .
Ses02M_impro05_F007 um well sometimes there is just difficulties with loading on to the plane . uh there can be a theft or uh some sort of you know mishap with a cart or something .
Ses02M_impro05_F008 i i i understand but um .
Ses02M_impro05_F009 okay
Ses02M_impro05_F010 right .
Ses02M_impro05_F011 i understand that . um so i m going to put down here that you looking for your baggage but we actually can t uh this bag is likely not going to show up so what we re going to do 
Ses02M_impro05_F012 sometimes it gets stolen sometimes it gets misplaced on another plane and
Ses02M_impro05_F013 they they it gets shipped to somewhere else and then it s stuck somewhere and then we have no way of tracking that .
Ses02M_impro05_F014 so we ll what we ll do
Ses02M_impro05_F015 right . like i said sometimes a theft and things happen like that but we are willing to reim reimburse you .
Ses02M_impro05_F016 um so .
Ses02M_impro05_F017 we have very tight security but we uh there are times when we just can t uh make sure there aren t absolutely no human error you know
Ses02M_impro05_F018 i m sorry there is no guarantee on baggage .
Ses02M_impro05_F019 i understand so 
Ses02M_impro05_F020 all right we ve already checked back here for your baggage
Ses02M_impro05_F021 and we will continue to look for it and because your paper 
Ses02M_impro05_F022 i ve already looked thank you very much and because we ve filled out paperwork if it shows up we will send it to you but otherwise what we can do is reimburse you for fifty dollar .
Ses02M_impro05_F023 well it s it s just sort of help with the fact uh that you lost some of your possessions and we rather do that than 
Ses02M_impro05_F024 the airline can t afford to give you everything that is in that suitcase . and so 
Ses02M_impro05_F025 well because lots of people get their baggage lost and we don t want to have false claims or anything like that so we have
Ses02M_impro05_F026 we can give you fifty dollar to sort of make up for it to compensate and we can definitely let you know if it shows up but likely more than likely 
Ses02M_impro05_F027 i m sorry . i don t i 
Ses02M_impro05_F028 i don t believe you should sue the airline company but we do have a policy uh in which we can reimburse you and that s all we can do and i m sorry i ve done everything i can 
Ses02M_impro05_F029 there s other people waiting 
Ses02M_impro05_F030 fine .
Ses02M_impro05_M000 hi . um 
Ses02M_impro05_M001 it seems that uh my my bag didn t make it out on the carousel .
Ses02M_impro05_M002 yes yes it s gone around like you know twenty times . it s been about a half hour .
Ses02M_impro05_M003 okay . so what what do i have to get you know
Ses02M_impro05_M004 for some reason so you think it won t show up ?
Ses02M_impro05_M005 what ? what ? how does that happen ?
Ses02M_impro05_M006 i really i really need that bag .
Ses02M_impro05_M007 there are i have important things in that bag . i ve got
Ses02M_impro05_M008 i mean i ve been away for a while and and now i ve i ve gifts for for you know friends and family i mean i got stuff in the there
Ses02M_impro05_M009 it s worth a lot .
Ses02M_impro05_M010 not going to show well isn t like wouldn t it just be at the airport that like if it didn t get on the other plane
Ses02M_impro05_M011 can they check there ?
Ses02M_impro05_M012 on another 
Ses02M_impro05_M013 but we have the tags on . i mean like it wouldn t you know if it got stuck somewhere it s like well this is nobodies bag i mean maybe you know look on the tag and
Ses02M_impro05_M014 see where it came from originally . i mean it seems like 
Ses02M_impro05_M015 theft ?
Ses02M_impro05_M016 theft ? don t you know like all these people that are work you keep like an eye on them how can they get away with 
Ses02M_impro05_M017 this is unbelievable . i ve got
Ses02M_impro05_M018 you don t realize the stuff that i ve got in that i really need to get the suitcase okay
Ses02M_impro05_M019 so if it s back there or something if there is something you can do
Ses02M_impro05_M020 i need you to tell me because i really need to get the bag okay ?
Ses02M_impro05_M021 you ve already checked ? can you check again ? garbage 
Ses02M_impro05_M022 fifty fifty dollars ? come on you have got to be joking .
Ses02M_impro05_M023 uh huh yea lost some of my possessions yes so if i lost maybe a shoe that was in the suitcase and like a carry on
Ses02M_impro05_M024 that might be like fifty dollars okay but this i garbage i had like thousands of dollars worth of stuff in that suitcase .

Ses02M_impro05_M026 i mean you re not helping me here . what do i have to do here ? do i need to sue the airline company is that what i should do

Ses02F_script02_1_F011 not particularly .
Ses02F_script02_1_F012 i just don t . it s stupid .
Ses02F_script02_1_F013 pass up what ? these little fish swim onto the beach they flop around and swim away . and then they die .
Ses02F_script02_1_F014 what are you so excited about ? i mean it s not a moon landing we re talking about here . it s fish . it s a fish nobody even eats .
Ses02F_script02_1_F015 ah augie .
Ses02F_script02_1_F016 i m just not .
Ses02F_script02_1_F017 yeah .
Ses02F_script02_1_F018 last year you will also remember our shoes got wet i got sand in my panties you got a sore throat we got in a big fight over nothing and we didn t see the grunions .
Ses02F_script02_1_F019 we didn t see them the first time either .
Ses02F_script02_1_F020 that s the wind .
Ses02F_script02_1_F021 about what ?
Ses02F_script02_1_F022 it s ridiculous .
Ses02F_script02_1_M000 what time is it ? they re supposed to run around midnight .
Ses02F_script02_1_M001 this is great isn t it ? look at the night we ve got here couldn t be better .
Ses02F_script02_1_M002 i would have liked to have gone a little further up the coast to get away from the lights and the people but i was afraid we d miss it .
Ses02F_script02_1_M003 how you doing ?
Ses02F_script02_1_M004 is that no is that just foam ? i can t even tell .
Ses02F_script02_1_M005 well i guess we can tell it probably isn t right ? probably be unmistakable don t you think ?
Ses02F_script02_1_M006 how you doing ? aw you know what i forgot ? i forgot to bring my flashlight . oh how could i be so stupid ? i should ve brought my flashlight .
Ses02F_script02_1_M007 you know the flashlight the silver one . there s only one isn t there ?
Ses02F_script02_1_M008 who s is it ?
Ses02F_script02_1_M009 oh well sure .
Ses02F_script02_1_M010 right of course . our flashlight . mine and yours . i mean me flashlight is su flashlight naturally .
Ses02F_script02_1_M011 how could we forget to bring it ? i hope the moon stays out .
Ses02F_script02_1_M012 i wonder do they always run during a full moon ? i can t remember if it was full last year . do you remember ?
Ses02F_script02_1_M013 you cold ? do you want my jacket ? oh we should ve brought the blanket . our blanket .
Ses02F_script02_1_M014 this is great isn t it ? a six pack would be just the ticket right now .
Ses02F_script02_1_M015 i can t believe i forgot . i m like a kid . it s amazing i got out of the house with my fly zipped .
Ses02F_script02_1_M016 you think they can hear us talk ? or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around ?
Ses02F_script02_1_M017 do you want my jacket ?
Ses02F_script02_1_M018 are you kidding ? we d miss it . we just got here . what s the point of coming down here if we just turn around and go home .
Ses02F_script02_1_M019 right .
Ses02F_script02_1_M020 that s my point too .
Ses02F_script02_1_M021 no . no . that s not my point . the point is there s no point in coming down if we just leave . don t you want to see it ?
Ses02F_script02_1_M022 why not ?
Ses02F_script02_1_M023 honey this is a natural phenomenon . i mean this only happens once a year you know .
Ses02F_script02_1_M024 think about the people in kansas they had to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to see this . we live forty minutes away . it s too good to pass up .
Ses02F_script02_1_M025 yeah but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives . all that flopping is laying eggs or what do you spawning or mating . i mean 
Ses02F_script02_1_M026 this is a big night for these guys . life s last orgy .
Ses02F_script02_1_M027 yeah they do .
Ses02F_script02_1_M028 alright . but it s fish that do something that none of the other fish do . like the swallows returning to capistrano or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs .
Ses02F_script02_1_M029 there s there s a bit of the magic some unexplainable here . i don t see how you can not be interested .
Ses02F_script02_1_M030 for real ?
Ses02F_script02_1_M031 i don t get it . the first time we came here you said it was the best night of your life .
Ses02F_script02_1_M032 and last year i remember specifically you were so excited to go that you stubbed your toe rushing me out of the house and didn t even notice until we got in the car .
Ses02F_script02_1_M033 we weren t in a good spot .
Ses02F_script02_1_M034 we just weren t in a good spot . this is a much better spot . believe me i ve got good instincts for these things .
Ses02F_script02_1_M035 there is that no that s just seaweed isn t it ?
Ses02F_script02_1_M036 oh man this is great isn t it ? i wouldn t miss this for anything . here think about this all right i know you re not interested but think about this .
Ses02F_script02_1_M037 somewhere out there this huge mass of silver fish swimming this way .
Ses02F_script02_1_M038 they don t know why we don t know why . nobody sent them an invitation or a map it wasn t a decision just 
Ses02F_script02_1_M039 all as one this time release instinctual little firecracker went off and they all turned and formed a line as long as the california coast and started swimming . and they re swimming right now as if that s all that matters .
Ses02F_script02_1_M040 it s like single mindedness with no mind . it s urgency that s pure urge . they don t know what drives them . they don t ask it a question or give it a name .
Ses02F_script02_1_M041 they just turn as one and start the swim that brings them right here to where we stand for a massive celebration of sex and death .
Ses02F_script02_1_M042 ah god i m giving myself goose bumps . look all my hairs are popped up .
Ses02F_script02_1_M043 well so what do you think ?
Ses02F_script02_1_M044 what i was saying .
Ses02M_script01_2_F000 why did he invite her here ?
Ses02M_script01_2_F001 she s been in new york three and half years why all of a sudden 
Ses02M_script01_2_F002 nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see .
Ses02M_script01_2_F003 he s not going to marry her .
Ses02M_script01_2_F004 it s got that all about it .
Ses02M_script01_2_F005 what s going on here joe ?
Ses02M_script01_2_F006  she s not his girl joe she knows she s not .
Ses02M_script01_2_F007 then why is she still single i mean new york is full of men why isn t she married ? probably a hundred people told her she s crazy but she s waited .
Ses02M_script01_2_F008 she knows what i know that s why . she s faithful as a rock . in my worst moments i think of her waiting and i know again that i m right .
Ses02M_script01_2_F009 nobody in this house dares take her faith away joe . strangers might but not his father not his brother .
Ses02M_script01_2_F010 i want you to act like he s coming back both of you . don t you think i haven t noticed since he invited her i won t stand for any nonsense
Ses02M_script01_2_F011 because if he s not coming back i ll kill myself . and laugh laugh at me but
Ses02M_script01_2_F012 why did that happen the very night she came back she sleeps in his room and suddenly his memorial breaks to pieces just look at it look .
Ses02M_script01_2_F013 i need you to believe with me i can t stand all alone .
Ses02M_script01_2_F014 even last week there was a man who showed up in detroit missing longer than larry you read it yourself .
Ses02M_script01_2_F015 just you above all need to believe .
Ses02M_script01_2_F016 don t stop believing .
Ses02M_script01_2_F017 i can t help it .
Ses02M_script01_2_M000 why does that bother you ?
Ses02M_script01_2_M001 well maybe he just wanted to see her again .
Ses02M_script01_2_M002 what do you mean ? he lived next door to the girl all his life why wouldn t he want to see her again ?
Ses02M_script01_2_M003 don t look at me like that he didn t tell me any more than he told you .
Ses02M_script01_2_M004 how do you know he s even thinking of it ?
Ses02M_script01_2_M005 well so what ?
Ses02M_script01_2_M006 all right . now listen kid 
Ses02M_script01_2_M007 you can t read her mind .
Ses02M_script01_2_M008 how do you know why she has waited ?
Ses02M_script01_2_M009 look it s a nice day what are we arguing for ?
Ses02M_script01_2_M010 what do you want me to do about it ?
Ses02M_script01_2_M011 but kate
Ses02M_script01_2_M012 calm yourself .
Ses02M_script01_2_M013 calm yourself .
Ses02M_script01_2_M014 all right . all right . calm yourself .
Ses02M_script01_2_M015 wait why my above all ?
Ses02M_script01_2_M016 what does that mean me above all ?
Ses02M_script01_2_M017 look at you look at you shaking .
Ses02M_script01_2_M018 what have i got to hide ? what the hell is the matter with you kate ?
Ses02F_script01_1_F000 what s he gonna say ? maybe we ought to tell him before he sees it .
Ses02F_script01_1_F001 how could he see it ? i was the first one up he was still in bed .
Ses02F_script01_1_F002 when ?
Ses02F_script01_1_F003 what was he doing out here at four in the morning ?
Ses02F_script01_1_F004 did you talk to him ?
Ses02F_script01_1_F005 he cried hard ?
Ses02F_script01_1_F006 what was he doing out here at that hour ?
Ses02F_script01_1_F007 he s dreaming about him again . he s walking around at night .
Ses02F_script01_1_F008 he s getting just like after he died . what is the meaning of that ?
Ses02F_script01_1_F009 what ?
Ses02F_script01_1_F010 what you mean dishonest ?
Ses02F_script01_1_F011 what do you want to do argue with him ?
Ses02F_script01_1_F012 you can t say that to him .
Ses02F_script01_1_F013 can you prove it ? how can you prove it ?
Ses02F_script01_1_F014 to you it is and to me but not to him . i mean you can talk yourself blue in the face but he there s no body and no grave so where are you ?
Ses02F_script01_1_F015 trouble is the god damn newspapers . every month or so a boy turns up out of nowhere so you know the next one is gonna be larry .
Ses02F_script01_1_F016 why ?
Ses02F_script01_1_F017 i ve got an idea but what s the story ?
Ses02F_script01_1_F018 well that s only your business chris .
Ses02F_script01_1_F019 what do you want me to do ? you re old enough to know your own mind .
Ses02F_script01_1_F020 well you want to make sure that your father isn t going to 
Ses02F_script01_1_F021 i m just saying that 
Ses02F_script01_1_F022 i ignore what i gotta ignore . the girl is larry s girl .
Ses02F_script01_1_F023 from your father s point of view he isn t dead . and you ve no right to take his girl .
Ses02F_script01_1_F024 and you can go on from there if you know where to go but i don t know where to go . see i don t know . now what can i do for you ?
Ses02F_script01_1_F025 you re a considerate fellow . there s nothing wrong with that .
Ses02F_script01_1_F026  breathing have you asked annie yet ?
Ses02F_script01_1_F027 well how do you know she ll marry you ? maybe she feels the same way your father does .
Ses02F_script01_1_F028 trouble is you don t see enough women .
Ses02F_script01_1_F029 you never did .
Ses02F_script01_1_F030 i just don t see why it has to be annie .
Ses02F_script01_1_F031 well that s a good answer but it doesn t answer anything . i mean you ve been away for at war . it s been five years .
Ses02F_script01_1_F032 i don t want a diagram . umm he thinks he s coming back chris . you marry that girl and you re pronouncing him dead .
Ses02F_script01_1_F033 i mean what s gonna happen to your father ? do you know ? i don t .
Ses02F_script01_1_F034 i just give it some more thought .
Ses02F_script01_1_F035 what the hell is this ?
Ses02F_script01_1_F036 are you crazy ?
Ses02F_script01_1_F037 what about the business ? what the hell is this ?
Ses02F_script01_1_F038 must you be inspired ?
Ses02F_script01_1_F039 tell me you d leave the business ?
Ses02F_script01_1_F040 well you don t want to think like that .
Ses02F_script01_1_F041 all right but just don t go thinkin like that cause otherwise what did we work for ? i mean the whole thing is for you chris . the whole shootin match is for you .
Ses02F_script01_1_F042 all right . just just don t go thinkin that way you hear me ?
Ses02F_script01_1_F043 i don t understand you do i ?
Ses02F_script01_1_F044 i can see that .
Ses02F_script01_1_M000 he saw it .
Ses02F_script01_1_M001 he was out here when it broke .
Ses02F_script01_1_M002 about four this morning . i heard it cracking and i woke up and looked out . he was standing right here when it cracked .
Ses02F_script01_1_M003 i don t know . when it cracked he ran back in the house and cried in the kitchen .
Ses02F_script01_1_M004 no . i thought it was best to leave him alone .
Ses02F_script01_1_M005 i could hear him right through the floor of my room .
Ses02F_script01_1_M006 i guess he is .
Ses02F_script01_1_M007 i don t know the meaning of it . but i know one thing mom we made a terrible mistake with dad .
Ses02F_script01_1_M008 being dishonest with him . i mean that sort of thing always pays off and now it s paying off .
Ses02F_script01_1_M009 you know that larry s not coming back and i know it . why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him ?
Ses02F_script01_1_M010 no i don t want to argue with him but it s about time he realized that nobody believes larry s alive anymore ?
Ses02F_script01_1_M011 why shouldn t he dream of him and walk the nights waiting for him ? do we contradict him ? do we say straight out that we don t have any hope anymore ? that we haven t had hope for years now ?
Ses02F_script01_1_M012 we ve got to say it to him .
Ses02F_script01_1_M013 for god sakes it s been three years . nobody comes back after three years . it s insane .
Ses02F_script01_1_M014 sit down mom . i want to talk to you .
Ses02F_script01_1_M015 all right . all right . listen to me . you know why i brought annie here don t you ?
Ses02F_script01_1_M016 you know .
Ses02F_script01_1_M017 i m gonna ask her to marry me .
Ses02F_script01_1_M018 you know it s not only my business .
Ses02F_script01_1_M019 so it s all right then ?
Ses02F_script01_1_M020 i ll go ahead with it ?
Ses02F_script01_1_M021 well then it isn t just my business 
Ses02F_script01_1_M022 ah sometimes you infuriate me . you know that ? i mean isn t it your business too if i tell dad and flips freaks out about it ? i mean you have such a talent for ignoring things .
Ses02F_script01_1_M023 she s not larry s girl .
Ses02F_script01_1_M024 i don t know why but every time i reach out for something that i want i have to pull back cause someone else will suffer . my whole bloody life . time after time after time .
Ses02F_script01_1_M025 to hell with that .
Ses02F_script01_1_M026 i wanted to get this settled first .
Ses02F_script01_1_M027 well if she does then that s the end of it . but from her letters i think she s forgotten him . i ll find out . and then we ll thrash it out with dad right ? mom don t avoid me .
Ses02F_script01_1_M028 so what i m not fast with women .
Ses02F_script01_1_M029 because it is .
Ses02F_script01_1_M030 i can t help it . i know her best . i mean i grew up next door to her .
Ses02F_script01_1_M031 these years when i think of a wife i think of annie . what do you want a diagram ?
Ses02F_script01_1_M032 all right . all right then mom .
Ses02F_script01_1_M033 i ve given it three years of thought . i thought that if i waited dad would forget about larry and we could have a regular wedding and everything happy .
Ses02F_script01_1_M034 but if i can t if that can t happen here then i ll have to get out .
Ses02F_script01_1_M035 i ll get out . i ll get married and go live some place else . maybe new york .
Ses02F_script01_1_M036 i ve been a good son too long . a good sucker . i m through with it .
Ses02F_script01_1_M037 the business ? the business doesn t inspire me .
Ses02F_script01_1_M038 yes . i like it an hour a day . if i m gonna grub for my money all day long at least in the evening i want it beautiful .
Ses02F_script01_1_M039 i want a family . i want kids . i want something that i can give myself to . annie s in the middle of that . now where do i find it ?

Ses02F_script03_2_F002 no it wasn t . it was very pretty . i still have it and i wear it often .
Ses02F_script03_2_F003 no i didn t . you worked the whole thing up in your jealous imagination .
Ses02F_script03_2_F004 just a little perhaps nothing serious .
Ses02F_script03_2_F005 well what of it ?
Ses02F_script03_2_F006 it didn t hurt him at all and i enjoyed it .
Ses02F_script03_2_F007 well if you hadn t been so suspicious and nosey you never would have known a thing about it .
Ses02F_script03_2_F008 i m bored with this conversation .
Ses02F_script03_2_F009 no thanks .
Ses02F_script03_2_F010 don t see why you want any . you ve already had two glasses .
Ses02F_script03_2_F011 just seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing .
Ses02F_script03_2_F012 well it s become a habit with you .
Ses02F_script03_2_F013 don t be so stupid .
Ses02F_script03_2_F014 what ?
Ses02F_script03_2_F015 no just making myself fascinating for you .
Ses02F_script03_2_F016 a woman s job is to allure the man . watch me a minute will you ?
Ses02F_script03_2_F017 no it isn t .
Ses02F_script03_2_F018 oh be quiet .

Ses02F_script03_2_F022 i don t care do you understand ? i don t care . i don t care if they bark or roll about like hoops .
Ses02F_script03_2_F023 yes i did . quite a lot .
Ses02F_script03_2_F024 mind your own business .
Ses02F_script03_2_F025 you re quite insufferable
Ses02F_script03_2_F026 i expect it s because you re drunk .
Ses02F_script03_2_F027 you ve always had a weak head .
Ses02F_script03_2_F028 on the contrary a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy .
Ses02F_script03_2_F029 shut up .
Ses02F_script03_2_F030 not very funny dear . you d better have some more brandy .
Ses02F_script03_2_F031 why ?
Ses02F_script03_2_F032 there aren t any people upstairs . it s a photographer s studio .
Ses02F_script03_2_F033 they re away in tunis .
Ses02F_script03_2_F034 turn it on again please .
Ses02F_script03_2_F035 very well if you insist on being boorish and idiotic .
Ses02F_script03_2_F036 you are far too temperamental . try to control yourself .
Ses02F_script03_2_F037 stop it . go away . i hate you .
Ses02F_script03_2_F038 listen ? listen indeed . i am sick and tired of listening to you damn sadistic bully .
Ses02F_script03_2_F039 i hate you . stop it . stop it . i hate you do you hear ? you re conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible .
Ses02F_script03_2_F040 this is the end . finally and forever . do you hear me ? the end .
Ses02F_script03_2_F041 oh yes i am .
Ses02F_script03_2_F042 i am . let go of me . you re a cruel fiend and i hate and loathe you .
Ses02F_script03_2_F043 thank god i realized what you are i d never marry you again ever in my life . you re a cruel fiend and i hate you . you re a beast . you re a beast i hate you . stop it . stop it .
Ses02F_script03_2_M000 as a matter of fact the real cause of that row was peter burden .
Ses02F_script03_2_M001 i knew nothing of the sort . you took presents from him .
Ses02F_script03_2_M002 ah yes i remember it well . bristling with diamonds in the worst possible taste .
Ses02F_script03_2_M003 you went out of your way to torture me over peter burden .
Ses02F_script03_2_M004 you must admit he was in love with you wasn t he ?
Ses02F_script03_2_M005 you let him kiss you . you said you did .
Ses02F_script03_2_M006 what of it ?
Ses02F_script03_2_M007 well what about me ?
Ses02F_script03_2_M008 well that s a nice point of view i must say .
Ses02F_script03_2_M009 me too . bored stiff . you want some brandy ?
Ses02F_script03_2_M010 i think i ll have some .
Ses02F_script03_2_M011 no particular reason . anyhow they were very small ones .
Ses02F_script03_2_M012 you can hardly call three liquor glasses in a whole evening going on and on and on .
Ses02F_script03_2_M013 you needn t be so grand just because you don t happen to want any yourself at the moment .
Ses02F_script03_2_M014 really amanda .
Ses02F_script03_2_M015 nothing .
Ses02F_script03_2_M016 going out somewhere dear ?
Ses02F_script03_2_M017 that reply has broken my heart .
Ses02F_script03_2_M018 as a matter of fact that s perfectly true .
Ses02F_script03_2_M019 yes it is .
Ses02F_script03_2_M020 ah it s a pity you didn t have any more brandy . it might have made you a little less disagreeable .
Ses02F_script03_2_M021 snap snap snap like a little adder .
Ses02F_script03_2_M022 nonsense . they have a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap .
Ses02F_script03_2_M023 they snap .
Ses02F_script03_2_M024 did you see much of peter burden after our divorce ?
Ses02F_script03_2_M025 hmm i imagine you let him kiss you a good deal more then .
Ses02F_script03_2_M026 oh must have had a riotous time . no restraint at all . very enjoyable and never had much anyhow .
Ses02F_script03_2_M027 i m not in the least drunk .
Ses02F_script03_2_M028 as i mentioned before i have had three minute liquor glasses of brandy the whole evening long . a child of two couldn t get drunk on that .
Ses02F_script03_2_M029 oh very interesting . how about a child of four ? a child of six ? or a child of nine ?
Ses02F_script03_2_M030 we could get a good debate going about this don t you think ? intemperate tots .
Ses02F_script03_2_M031 all right . i will .
Ses02F_script03_2_M032 you better turn that off i think .
Ses02F_script03_2_M033 because it s late and it ll annoy the people upstairs .
Ses02F_script03_2_M034 there are people downstairs i suppose ?
Ses02F_script03_2_M035 this is no time of the year for tunis .
Ses02F_script03_2_M036 i ll do no such thing .
Ses02F_script03_2_M037 turn it off . it s driving me mad .
Ses02F_script03_2_M038 turn it off .
Ses02F_script03_2_M039 amanda listen . listen
Ses02F_script03_2_M040 very amusing indeed .
Ses02F_script03_2_M041 you re a vile tempered loose living wicked little beast and i hope to never see you again as long as i live .
Ses02F_script03_2_M042 you re not going like this .
Ses02F_script03_2_M043 you re not .
Ses02F_script03_2_M044 shut up . shut up .
Ses02F_script03_2_M045 i wouldn t i wouldn t marry 
Ses02F_script03_2_M046 i wouldn t marry you if you came in crawling on your knees
Ses02F_script03_2_M047 you re a evil vampire and i hope to god i never see you again as long as i live .
Ses02M_script03_1_F000 do you think it s them ?
Ses02M_script03_1_F001 well nobody knows we re here except freda and she wouldn t ring up .
Ses02M_script03_1_F002 what are we going to do ?
Ses02M_script03_1_F003 now and always sweet .
Ses02M_script03_1_F004 it s bound to come sooner or later .
Ses02M_script03_1_F005 oh . it sends shivers down my spine .
Ses02M_script03_1_F006 behave exquisitely .
Ses02M_script03_1_F007 yes i should probably to a court curtsey .
Ses02M_script03_1_F008 what s so horrible is that one can t stay happy .
Ses02M_script03_1_F009 it s true the whole business is a very poor joke .
Ses02M_script03_1_F010 yes . meaning just that .
Ses02M_script03_1_F011 don t laugh at me . i m serious .
Ses02M_script03_1_F012 who s they ?
Ses02M_script03_1_F013 well if i laugh at everything then i must laugh at us too .
Ses02M_script03_1_F014 well shall we always want to bicker and fight ?
Ses02M_script03_1_F015 oh dear should we like that ?
Ses02M_script03_1_F016 well what happens if one of us dies does the one that s left still laugh ?
Ses02M_script03_1_F017 well that s serious enough isn t it ?
Ses02M_script03_1_F018 darling i believe you re talking nonsense .
Ses02M_script03_1_F019 elliot worms don t pop .
Ses02M_script03_1_F020 thank you dear the same applies you except that if i catch you so much as looking at another woman i ll kill you .
Ses02M_script03_1_F021 which particular one ?
Ses02M_script03_1_F022 oh charles that was his name charles . it did wiggle so beautifully .
Ses02M_script03_1_F023 i know you did . you threw it out of the window into the grand canal i don t think i ll ever forgive you for that .
Ses02M_script03_1_F024 it went on intermittently for days .
Ses02M_script03_1_F025 it burned my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom .
Ses02M_script03_1_F026 that was the first time you ever hit me .
Ses02M_script03_1_F027 the manager came in and found us rolling around on the floor biting and scratching like panthers .
Ses02M_script03_1_F028 oh it was ridiculous completely ridiculous .
Ses02M_script03_1_F029 and very much sillier .
Ses02M_script03_1_M000 good god .
Ses02M_script03_1_M001 i wonder .
Ses02M_script03_1_M002 must be them then .
Ses02M_script03_1_M003 we re all right darling aren t we whatever happens ?
Ses02M_script03_1_M004 i don t care then .
Ses02M_script03_1_M005 hello ? hello ? what ? wrong number .
Ses02M_script03_1_M006 what do we do if they suddenly walk in on us ?
Ses02M_script03_1_M007 with the most perfect poise .
Ses02M_script03_1_M008 things that ought to matter dreadfully don t matter at all when one s is happy do they ?
Ses02M_script03_1_M009 oh darling don t say that .
Ses02M_script03_1_M010 meaning that sacred and beautiful thing love ?
Ses02M_script03_1_M011 what does it all mean that s what i ask that s what i ask myself in my ceaseless quest for ultimate truth ? good god what does it all mean ?
Ses02M_script03_1_M012 you mustn t be serious my dear one that s just what they want .
Ses02M_script03_1_M013 all those futile moralists who try to make life unbearable laugh at them be flippant . laugh at everything all their sacred shibboleths
Ses02M_script03_1_M014 flippancy brings out the acid in their damned sweetness in light .
Ses02M_script03_1_M015 certainly you must we figures of fun all right .
Ses02M_script03_1_M016 no that desire will fade along with our passion .
Ses02M_script03_1_M017 depends on how well we play it .
Ses02M_script03_1_M018 yes yes with all his might .
Ses02M_script03_1_M019 no no it isn t death is very laughable such a cunning little mystery all done with mirrors .
Ses02M_script03_1_M020 so is everyone else in the long run .
Ses02M_script03_1_M021 let s be superficial and pity the poor philosophers let s blow our trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as much as we can . like quite idiotic very small school children . let s savor the delight of the moment .
Ses02M_script03_1_M022 come kiss me darling before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets .
Ses02M_script03_1_M023 i don t care what you do see . you can paint yourself green and dance naked in the place vendome and rush off madly with all the men in the world and i shan t say a word as long as you love me best .
Ses02M_script03_1_M024 you remember that awful scene we had in venice ?
Ses02M_script03_1_M025 the one when you bought that little painted wooden snake in the piazza and put it on my bed .
Ses02M_script03_1_M026 horrible thing i hated it .
Ses02M_script03_1_M027 how long did that row last ?
Ses02M_script03_1_M028 the worst one was in cannes when your curling iron burned a hole in my new dressing gown .
Ses02M_script03_1_M029 that was a rouser wasn t it ?
Ses02M_script03_1_M030 i didn t hit you very hard .
Ses02M_script03_1_M031 i ll never forget his face .
Ses02M_script03_1_M032 we were very much younger then .
Ses02M_script03_1_M033 as a matter of fact the real cause of that row was peter burden .
Ses02M_script02_1_F000 fine .
Ses02M_script02_1_F001 what flashlight ?
Ses02M_script02_1_F002 that s not your flashlight .

Ses02M_script02_1_F019 we didn t see them the first time either .
Ses02M_script02_1_F020 that s the wind .
Ses02M_script02_1_F021 about what ?
Ses02M_script02_1_F022 it s ridiculous .
Ses02M_script02_1_M000 what time is it ? they re supposed to run around midnight .
Ses02M_script02_1_M001 god this great isn t it ? like look at the night we go here it couldn t be better .
Ses02M_script02_1_M002 i would have wanted to go a little further up the coast get away from the lights and the people but i was afraid we d miss it .
Ses02M_script02_1_M003 how you doing ?
Ses02M_script02_1_M004 is that is that no ? was that just foam ? i can t even tell .
Ses02M_script02_1_M005 although i guess you can t tell it probably isn t them . probably be unmistakable don t you think ?
Ses02M_script02_1_M006 how you doing ? you know what i forgot ? i forgot to bring my flashlight . how how could i forget to bring my flashlight ? how could i be so stupid ?
Ses02M_script02_1_M007 you know the flashlight the silver one there is only one isn t there ?

Ses02M_script02_1_M021 no . no . that s not my point . the point is there is no point in coming down here if we just leave . don t you want to see it ?
Ses02M_script02_1_M022 why not ?
Ses02M_script02_1_M023 honey this is a natural phenomenon . i mean it only happens once a year .
Ses02M_script02_1_M024 think about the people in kansas they they d have to get a plane ticket and hotel reservations to see this . we live forty minutes away it s too good to pass up .
Ses02M_script02_1_M025 yea but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives . i mean all that flopping is laying eggs or what do you mating or spotting or something like that .
Ses02M_script02_1_M026 this is a big night for these guys life s last orgy .
Ses02M_script02_1_M027 yes they do .
Ses02M_script02_1_M028 okay . but it s fish that do something none of the other fish do . like the swallows returning to capistrano or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs
Ses02M_script02_1_M029 you know there is like there is a certain mystery here a magic a bit of the unexplainable . i don t see how you cannot be interested .
Ses02M_script02_1_M030 for real ?
Ses02M_script02_1_M031 i don t get it . the first time we came here you said it was the best night of your life .

Ses02M_script02_1_M038 they don t why we don t know why . they didn t take a vote or anything they didn t get a map or an invitation .
Ses02M_script02_1_M039 just all as one . this little time sensitive firecracker instinctual firecracker in their body just went off and all as one they turned and formed a line as long the california coast and started swimming . they re swimming right now as if that s the only thing that matters .
Ses02M_script02_1_M040 it s single mindedness with no mind it s urgency that s pure urge they don t know what drives them . they don t ask it a name or ask it a question 
Ses02M_script02_1_M041 they just turn as one and start the swim and brings them right here to this spot where we stand for a massive celebration of sex and death .

Ses02F_impro04_F000 i m every lead that i get ends up just being a dead end . you know what i mean . people are sick of me calling 
Ses02F_impro04_F001 yeah but it i mean it s the same response you get over and over again . like 
Ses02F_impro04_F002 oh we re not hiring at this time or thank you we already have your information on file we ll call you when we re ready .
Ses02F_impro04_F003 but it s been so long like i mine as well just take a job at mcdonald s . like i don t 
Ses02F_impro04_F004 i just i can t do it anymore . like it just takes it out of you 
Ses02F_impro04_F005 i just keep getting rejected . i just keep getting rejected over and over and over again and it starts to make you feel like there must be something wrong with you that you can t get a job .
Ses02F_impro04_F006 yeah but maybe if just because it s competitive like maybe i m just not good enough . maybe the level is here and i m here and there s just no way i m ever gonna do that 
Ses02F_impro04_F007 i didn t have like one of those starts you know like a family member who was already in the business or something you know that could like give me a helping hand .
Ses02F_impro04_F008 it s just so frustrating . like i just i just don t wanna do it anymore . you know ? i just don t wanna like hit the pavement every single day with my resumes and going out there all the time . you know it s just like 
Ses02F_impro04_F009 i feel so worthless .
Ses02F_impro04_F010 and what would make you say that ? there doesn t seem to be any indicators that anything s going to get better .
Ses02F_impro04_F011 it s just really hard . i feel like their starting to get like a personal prejudice against me . you know what i mean ? like it s like suddenly it starts to feel like it s just you that they say no to and it s not that they re not taking applications and it s not that they re not hiring people it s just you particularly they have some particular reason for just hating you . you know ?
Ses02F_impro04_F012 or they ll never talk to me again .
Ses02F_impro04_F013 i i just i think maybe i should try something else . i mean i i don t know . all growing up this is the only thing that i ever wanted to do and yet i can t . i m not physically able apparently . i mean 
Ses02F_impro04_F014 i guess the money shouldn t matter to me but somehow it does . you know ? it s not like i do it for the money but
Ses02F_impro04_F015 you have to i mean if you re hired by somebody then you re not a professional you re an amateur and that means that you re not good enough .
Ses02F_impro04_F016 i just wanna crawl in a hole you know . like it just makes you not wanna even open your eyes in the morning .
Ses02F_impro04_F017 i don t know how to get out of it . i don t know how to dig myself out of it . it s the same hole that i ve been digging and digging and digging . i can t 
Ses02F_impro04_M000 so uh so how s it been going ? i mean you have any needs or anything ?
Ses02F_impro04_M001 no . you can t think that way . i mean it s good it s good that you re that you re calling you know . you can t
Ses02F_impro04_M002 yeah i know what you mean . i ve gone through like similar stuff but 
Ses02F_impro04_M003 no come on . don t garbage 
Ses02F_impro04_M004 i know . i know . it s hard but you just you gotta keep going . i mean you ve been going at it for so long you know . something is definitely going to come up . i i know it will because you re a good worker 
Ses02F_impro04_M005 no . it s i mean it s competitive you know . that s that s what it is . that s what you gotta be is competitive .
Ses02F_impro04_M006 there . . .there are plenty of people out there with with like good jobs you know that are a lot . . .
Ses02F_impro04_M007  . . .dumber than you . i mean they re a lot worse off than you . you are much better off than like a lot of those people in there . i know
Ses02F_impro04_M008 i know . it makes it harder . i mean it s definitely who you know in a lot of cases but 
Ses02F_impro04_M009 but you gotta . otherwise what is what s your other option ?
Ses02F_impro04_M010 it s not worthless cause it s definitely gonna it s definitely gonna pay off . i know it . i mean i can i ve just i ve seen your work etiquette . you know you re a good worker and . . .
Ses02F_impro04_M011  . . . and there s no reason that that something won t come up like really soon . all right ? so you just gotta 
Ses02F_impro04_M012 because i know you . you know and maybe once you get to know some more people like talking to them and everything they ll get to know you too and they ll realize they should ve hired you three years ago . you know ? but and and they ll finally come around and believe me it ll you gotta 
Ses02F_impro04_M013 well maybe yeah but maybe you get to that point where it s like you bug em and then they just don t wanna hear from you anymore but you keep bugging them and bugging them and then it s gonna annoy them so much that they re gonna be like all right fine . you know
Ses02F_impro04_M014 or well no . okay . you garbage 
Ses02F_impro04_M015 that obviously that s not true though . i mean you ve done this before . you ve done all the work like this before you know and and you ve gotten people saying oh you re so good and like you know

Ses02M_script03_2_F003 no i didn t you worked the whole thing up in your jealous imagination .
Ses02M_script03_2_F004 just a little perhaps nothing serious .
Ses02M_script03_2_F005 what of it ?
Ses02M_script03_2_F006 it gave him a lot of pleasure it didn t hurt me any .
Ses02M_script03_2_F007 well if you hadn t been so nosey and suspicious you never wouldn t have known anything about it .

Ses02M_script03_2_F010 i don t see why you want any you ve already had two glasses .
Ses02M_script03_2_F011 it just seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing .
Ses02M_script03_2_F012 well it s become a habit with you .
Ses02M_script03_2_F013 don t be so stupid .
Ses02M_script03_2_F014 what ?

Ses02M_script03_2_F023 i don t care . do you understand ? i don t care . i don t care if they bark or roll about like hoops .
Ses02M_script03_2_F024 yes i did quite a lot .
Ses02M_script03_2_F025 mind your own business .
Ses02M_script03_2_F026 you re quite insufferable . i expect it s because you re drunk .
Ses02M_script03_2_F027 on the contrary a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy .
Ses02M_script03_2_F028 oh be quiet .
Ses02M_script03_2_F029 not very funny my dear you better have some more brandy .
Ses02M_script03_2_F030 why ?
Ses02M_script03_2_F031 there aren t any people upstairs it s a photographer s studio .
Ses02M_script03_2_F032 they re away in tunis .
Ses02M_script03_2_F033 turn it on again please .
Ses02M_script03_2_F034 very well if you insist on being boorish and idiotic .
Ses02M_script03_2_F035 you are far too temperamental . try to control yourself .
Ses02M_script03_2_F036 stop it . stop it . i hate you .
Ses02M_script03_2_F037 listen indeed . i m sick and tired of listening to you damn sadistic bully .
Ses02M_script03_2_F038 stop it . stop it . i hate you do you hear ? you re overbearing and conceited and utterly impossible .
Ses02M_script03_2_F039 this is the end do you hear ? the end finally and forever .
Ses02M_script03_2_F040 oh yes i am .
Ses02M_script03_2_F041 yes i am . let go of me you re cruel fiend and i hate and loathe you . thank god i realized who you really are before i would ever ever marry you again . i would never marry you again . i d rather die in torment .
Ses02M_script03_2_F042 you re a beast . i hate you . stop it . stop it .
Ses02M_script03_2_M000 as a matter of fact the real cause of that row was peter burden .
Ses02M_script03_2_M001 i knew nothing of the sort . you took presents from him .
Ses02M_script03_2_M002 yes i remember it well bristling with diamonds in the worst possible taste .
Ses02M_script03_2_M003 you went out of your way to torture me over peter burden .
Ses02M_script03_2_M004 you must admit he was in love with you wasn t he ?
Ses02M_script03_2_M005 you let him kiss you you said you did .
Ses02M_script03_2_M006 what of it ?
Ses02M_script03_2_M007 what about me ?
Ses02M_script03_2_M008 that s a nice point of view i must say .
Ses02M_script03_2_M009 yes me too bored stiff . you want some brandy ?
Ses02M_script03_2_M010 i have a little i think .
Ses02M_script03_2_M011 no particular reason . anyhow they are very small ones .
Ses02M_script03_2_M012 you can hardly call three liquor glasses in a whole evening going on and on and on .
Ses02M_script03_2_M013 you needn t be so grand just because don t happen want any yourself right now .
Ses02M_script03_2_M014 really amanda .
Ses02M_script03_2_M015 nothing .
Ses02M_script03_2_M016 going out somewhere dear ?
Ses02M_script03_2_M017 that reply has broken my heart .
Ses02M_script03_2_M018 as a matter of fact that s perfectly true .
Ses02M_script03_2_M019 yes it is .
Ses02M_script03_2_M020 it s a pity you didn t have any more brandy it might have made you a little less disagreeable .
Ses02M_script03_2_M021 snap snap snap like a little adder .
Ses02M_script03_2_M022 oh nonsense they have a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap .
Ses02M_script03_2_M023 they snap .
Ses02M_script03_2_M024 tell me did you see much of peter burden after our divorce ?
Ses02M_script03_2_M025 i imagine you let him kiss you good deal more then .
Ses02M_script03_2_M026 what riotous time you must have had .
Ses02M_script03_2_M027 no restraint at all very enjoyable never had much anyhow .
Ses02M_script03_2_M028 i am not in the least drunk .
Ses02M_script03_2_M029 i imagine as i may have already mentioned i ve had three minute liquor glasses of brandy the whole evening long a child of two couldn t get drunk on that .
Ses02M_script03_2_M030 oh very interesting . how about a child of four a child of six or a child of nine ?
Ses02M_script03_2_M031 we can get a good little debate going about that don t you think ? intemperate tots .
Ses02M_script03_2_M032 all right . i will .
Ses02M_script03_2_M033 better turn that off i think .
Ses02M_script03_2_M034 because it s late and it ll annoy the people upstairs .
Ses02M_script03_2_M035 there are people downstairs i suppose ?

Ses02F_impro05_F000 hi um excuse me i believe that the airline lost my baggage .
Ses02F_impro05_F001 no it didn t . um it didn t come out and i don t see it anywhere around here so what can you do about that ?
Ses02F_impro05_F002 some problems ? what is that supposed to mean ?
Ses02F_impro05_F003 how do you lose a suitcase ? a huge suitcase ?
Ses02F_impro05_F004 how much ?
Ses02F_impro05_F005 fifty dollars ? for my suitcase ? i mean the suitcase itself was like a hundred and fifty dollar just for the suitcase but all the things inside all my clothes all my personal belongings the sentimental value not to mention which is more more than all of that together .
Ses02F_impro05_F006 that s all that s all that s all you re going to do is just give me fifty dollars and say go have fun on your vacation without any of your stuff ?

Ses02F_impro05_M012 you paid for the flight and then your bags were checked at it s a service that the airline provides for us . so so really it s really the risk was taken and i m sorry but there s really nothing else we can do . so do you want do you want the reimbursement ?

Ses02F_impro05_M014 no um like i said you can file a claim and uh maybe get reimbursed for more you

Ses02F_script01_3_F015 well i was waiting for you . i mean till then you never wrote and when you did i mean what did you say ? you can sure be ambiguous sometimes .
Ses02F_script01_3_F016 i will never forgive you . why did you wait all these years ? all i did was sit and wonder if i was crazy for thinking of you .
Ses02F_script01_3_F017 not like that you re not .

Ses02F_script01_3_F021 you ve gotta tell me .

Ses02F_script01_3_F028 i mean and your money there s nothing wrong with your money . i mean your father put hundreds of planes in the air . a man should be paid for that .

Ses02F_script01_3_M001 you re not sorry you came ?
Ses02F_script01_3_M002 why ?
Ses02F_script01_3_M003 oh .
Ses02F_script01_3_M004 what ?
Ses02F_script01_3_M005 the trouble is i planned on sort of sneaking up on you over a period of a week or so . but they take it for granted that we re all set .
Ses02F_script01_3_M006 oh . would you want to ? i guess you know this is why i asked you to come .
Ses02F_script01_3_M007 anne i love you . i love you a great deal . i love you .
Ses02F_script01_3_M008 i have no imagination . that s all i know to tell you .
Ses02F_script01_3_M009 i m embarrassing you and i didn t want to tell it to you here . i wanted some place we d never been before . a place where we d be brand new to each other .
Ses02F_script01_3_M010 you feel it s wrong here don t you ? this yard this chair . i want you to be ready for me . i don t want to have to win you away from anything .
Ses02F_script01_3_M011 and he s gone forever . you re sure ?
Ses02F_script01_3_M012 why didn t you ?
Ses02F_script01_3_M013 you felt something that far back ?
Ses02F_script01_3_M014 anne why didn t you let me know ?
Ses02F_script01_3_M015 give me a kiss anne . give me a 
Ses02F_script01_3_M016 oh god i kissed you . i kissed annie . how long how long i ve been waiting to kiss you .
Ses02F_script01_3_M017 oh annie we re gonna live now . i m gonna make you so happy .
Ses02F_script01_3_M018 i kissed you .
Ses02F_script01_3_M019 let s drive someplace . i want to be alone with you .
Ses02F_script01_3_M020 no . nothing like that .
Ses02F_script01_3_M021 yeah i suppose i have been . but it s going from me .
Ses02F_script01_3_M022 i don t know how to start .
Ses02F_script01_3_M023 it s all mixed up with so many other things . you remember overseas i was in command of a company ?
Ses02F_script01_3_M024 well i lost them .
Ses02F_script01_3_M025 just about all .
Ses02F_script01_3_M026 it takes some time for a guy to toss that off . cause they weren t just men .
Ses02F_script01_3_M027 for instance one time it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks . i put them in pocket . it s only a little thing but that s the kind of guys i had .
Ses02F_script01_3_M028 they didn t die they killed themselves for each other . i mean that exactly . a little more selfish and they d have been here today .
Ses02F_script01_3_M029 i got this idea watching them go down . everything was being destroyed see but it seemed that there was one new thing being made . a sort of responsibility . man for man .
Ses02F_script01_3_M030 you know what i mean ? to show that to bring that onto the earth again like some kind of monument and everyone would feel it standing behind him and it would make a difference to him .
Ses02F_script01_3_M031 then i came back and it was incredible . there was no meaning in it here . the whole thing to them seemed like sort of a bus accident . i went to work with dad and that rat race again .
Ses02F_script01_3_M032 and i felt what you said ashamed somehow cause nobody was changed at all . it seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys . i felt wrong to be alive to open the new bank book drive the new car see the new refrigerator .
Ses02F_script01_3_M033 i mean you can take those things out of a war but when you drive that car you ve gotta know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man . you ve gotta be a little better because of it .
Ses02F_script01_3_M034 because otherwise all you have is really loot and there s blood on it . and i didn t want to take any of it . and i guess that included you .
Ses02F_script01_3_M035 i want you now annie .
Ses02F_script01_3_M036 i know annie . annie i m gonna make a fortune for you .

Ses03M_script02_2_F012 look it s pointless . it s . . .we re not going to see the grunions i mean it s like waiting around to see santa claus you know it s . . .
Ses03M_script02_2_F013 listen i ve waiting my entire life on this beach just standing there waiting for this fish to show up and these fish never show up .

Ses03M_script02_2_F016 no we won t . i mean god this isn t about the fish augie .
Ses03M_script02_2_F017 look do you remember the first time we came here ?
Ses03M_script02_2_F018 we thought i was pregnant .
Ses03M_script02_2_F019 we brought a bottle of champagne and we took off our shoes and danced barefoot in the sand . . .
Ses03M_script02_2_F020 under the moon and you whispered so softly into my ear so i could feel your words .
Ses03M_script02_2_F021 and i thought this is it . this is how happy i m supposed to be .
Ses03M_script02_2_F022 what ? dancing barefoot in the sand ? drinking out of a bottle of champagne ?
Ses03M_script02_2_F023 i d rather not remember something . . .
Ses03M_script02_2_F024 rather not hope for something .
Ses03M_script02_2_F025 no .
Ses03M_script02_2_F026 no .

Ses03M_script02_2_F040 if anybody wants to be with anybody else it s probably you . probably somebody who enjoys herself a little more and is not so hard .
Ses03M_script02_2_F041 well i guess this is the wrong spot for the right people .
Ses03M_script02_2_F042 yeah . i noticed that . it s real pretty on the water .

Ses03M_script02_2_M003 i m not the only one . look at all these people .
Ses03M_script02_2_M004 are we talking about the same thing ?
Ses03M_script02_2_M005 i thought you wanted to see it .

Ses03M_script03_2_F003 no i didn t . you made up the whole thing in your jealous imagination .
Ses03M_script03_2_F004 just a little perhaps but nothing serious .

Ses03M_script03_2_F006 well it didn t harm him in fact it pleasured him a lot and it didn t hurt me .

Ses03M_script03_2_F028 mind your business .
Ses03M_script03_2_F029 you re quite insufferable . i expect it s because you re drunk .
Ses03M_script03_2_F030 you ve always had a weak head .
Ses03M_script03_2_F031 on the contrary a child of two can get violently drunk off just one glass of brandy .
Ses03M_script03_2_F032 shut up .
Ses03M_script03_2_F033 not very funny dear . in fact maybe you better have some more brandy .
Ses03M_script03_2_F034 why ?
Ses03M_script03_2_F035 there aren t any people upstairs . this is a photographer s studio .
Ses03M_script03_2_F036 they are away in tunis .
Ses03M_script03_2_F037 turn it on again please .
Ses03M_script03_2_F038 very well . if you insist on being a boorish and idiotic .
Ses03M_script03_2_F039 you are far too temperamental . try to control yourself .
Ses03M_script03_2_F040 go away . go away . i hate you .
Ses03M_script03_2_F041 i hate you . listen i m sick and tired of listening to you you sadistic bully .
Ses03M_script03_2_F042 this is the end . understand ? this is the end here and now forever and always .
Ses03M_script03_2_F043 oh yes i am . yes i am and you can t stop me .
Ses03M_script03_2_F044 listen you re a cruel fiend and i hate loathe you . thank god finally finally thank god i ve realized just how horrible you are and marry you ? marry you ? never . i will never marry you . i will die die in torment 
Ses03M_script03_2_F045 beast . brute . cad . swine . beast . beast . brute . devil . sorry .
Ses03M_script03_2_M000 yes . the real cause of that rile was peter burden .
Ses03M_script03_2_M001 i knew nothing of the sort . you took presents from him .
Ses03M_script03_2_M002 mmm hmm . i remember it well . bristling with diamonds in the worst possible taste .
Ses03M_script03_2_M003 you went out of your way to torture me over peter burden .
Ses03M_script03_2_M004 you must admit he was in love with you .
Ses03M_script03_2_M005 you let him kiss you . you said so . what of it ?
Ses03M_script03_2_M006 and what about me ?
Ses03M_script03_2_M007 oh that s a nice point of view i must say .
Ses03M_script03_2_M008 yeah so am i . bored stiff .
Ses03M_script03_2_M009 you want some brandy ?
Ses03M_script03_2_M010 i ll have a little i think .
Ses03M_script03_2_M011 no particular reason . anyhow they were very small ones .
Ses03M_script03_2_M012 oh my . . .just because i just . . .okay . . .
Ses03M_script03_2_M013  . . .having three small minute liquor glasses in the evening is hardly going on and on and on .
Ses03M_script03_2_M014 you needn t be so grand just because you don t happen to want any yourself at the moment .
Ses03M_script03_2_M015 really amanda .
Ses03M_script03_2_M016 nothing .
Ses03M_script03_2_M017 going out somewhere dear ?
Ses03M_script03_2_M018 that reply has broken my heart .
Ses03M_script03_2_M019 actually that s perfectly true .
Ses03M_script03_2_M020 yes it is .
Ses03M_script03_2_M021 i think that
Ses03M_script03_2_M022 perhaps maybe you should ve had more brandy it might ve made you a little less disagreeable .
Ses03M_script03_2_M023 hmm snap snap snap like a little adder .
Ses03M_script03_2_M024 yes they do . they have a bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap .
Ses03M_script03_2_M025 they snap .
Ses03M_script03_2_M026 did you see much of peter burden after our divorce ?
Ses03M_script03_2_M027 i suppose you let him kiss you a great deal more then ?
Ses03M_script03_2_M028 mmm you must ve had a riotous time . no restraint at all very enjoyable . you never had much anyhow .
Ses03M_script03_2_M029 i m not in the least bit drunk .
Ses03M_script03_2_M030 okay like i mentioned before i had three very small minute liquor glasses of brandy . that s not even enough to get a child of two drunk .
Ses03M_script03_2_M031 oh what an interesting topic . what about a child of four and a child of six ? a child of nine ?
Ses03M_script03_2_M032 we might be able to bring up a splendid little debate about this intemperate tots .
Ses03M_script03_2_M033 oh thanks . i think i will .
Ses03M_script03_2_M034 you better turn that off .
Ses03M_script03_2_M035 because people upstairs will get annoyed .
Ses03M_script03_2_M036 well there are people downstairs i suppose .
Ses03M_script03_2_M037 oh this is no time to be in here for tunis .
Ses03M_script03_2_M038 no i ll do no such thing .
Ses03M_script03_2_M039 come on turn it off . it s driving me mad .
Ses03M_script03_2_M040 turn it turn it off .
Ses03M_script03_2_M041 very amusing indeed .
Ses03M_script03_2_M042 you know what ? you re a vile little evil minded little wicked beast and i never want to see you again .
Ses03M_script03_2_M043 you re not going nowhere . no you re not .
Ses03M_script03_2_M044 just shut up .
Ses03M_script03_2_M045 shut up . shut up . i would i would never marry you again if you came crawling back to me on your hands and knees because you re an evil minded little vampire and i hope to god i never see you again .
Ses03M_script03_2_M046 oh .

Ses03F_script02_2_F003 exactly . everyone else is told the same thing . it keeps them feeling excited . keeps them coming back . keeps them thinking life s going to start at any minute now .
Ses03F_script02_2_F004 i don t care . it s still fish to me .
Ses03F_script02_2_F005 augie goddamn it don t ask me that . you always ask me that . why do you ask me that ? i hate it . it s insulting .
Ses03F_script02_2_F006 look it s we just we re looking at this evening in a different way both of us . we both have different ideas of it .
Ses03F_script02_2_F007 it s not like that .
Ses03F_script02_2_F008 look augie we ve never seen them . they re never going to come .
Ses03F_script02_2_F009 twice is as many times as we ve tried . that s ever .
Ses03F_script02_2_F010 no we won t .
Ses03F_script02_2_F011 it s impossible . it s like waiting around . waiting to see santa claus you know ?
Ses03F_script02_2_F012 like i feel like my whole life i ve been just standing on this beach with my hands clasped waiting for these fish to show up and these fish never show up .
Ses03F_script02_2_F013 i do .
Ses03F_script02_2_F014 look i did . i always do . but it s like every time i try nothing ever happens .
Ses03F_script02_2_F015 for god s sake augie this is not about fish .
Ses03F_script02_2_F016 do you remember the last time we came here ?
Ses03F_script02_2_F017 we thought i was pregnant .
Ses03F_script02_2_F018 you brought a bottle of champagne .
Ses03F_script02_2_F019 we took off our shoes and we danced barefoot in the sand . under the moon .
Ses03F_script02_2_F020 and you whispered so intimately in my ear so i could feel your words .
Ses03F_script02_2_F021 oh that moment that was it .
Ses03F_script02_2_F022 i told myself finally this is how happy i m supposed to be .
Ses03F_script02_2_F023 dancing barefoot in the sand . drinking out of a bottle of champagne .
Ses03F_script02_2_F024 i don t want to remember something .
Ses03F_script02_2_F025 hope for some things .
Ses03F_script02_2_F026 no .
Ses03F_script02_2_F027 no .
Ses03F_script02_2_F028 no no .
Ses03F_script02_2_F029 no .
Ses03F_script02_2_F030 no .
Ses03F_script02_2_F031 no .
Ses03F_script02_2_F032 no .
Ses03F_script02_2_F033 i want things to turn out the way that they re supposed to be .
Ses03F_script02_2_F034 this what ? what is this ? this is nothing .
Ses03F_script02_2_F035 no it s not . it s standing on the beach waiting and fighting .
Ses03F_script02_2_F036 things have never turned out anything the way that i thought they would be .
Ses03F_script02_2_F037 i mean this is this is everything and it s a lot but
Ses03F_script02_2_F038 it s not something else . do you know what i m trying to say ?
Ses03F_script02_2_F039 i know you are augie and i know you wanted this evening to be nice but i can t help thinking of being somewhere else .
Ses03F_script02_2_F040 i didn t say that .
Ses03F_script02_2_F041 augie anything i do i d rather be doing with you .
Ses03F_script02_2_F042 god don t you know that ? i mean you re the one that probably wants to be with somebody else . somebody that didn t take herself so seriously could enjoy herself more .
Ses03F_script02_2_F043 well i guess we re just in the wrong spart spot with the right person .
Ses03F_script02_2_F044 i noticed that . it s beautiful .
Ses03F_script02_2_F045 you can see right over the water .
Ses03F_script02_2_F046 god big old white moon .
Ses03F_script02_2_F047 you brought refreshments ?
Ses03F_script02_2_F048 at least we won t need glasses .
Ses03F_script02_2_F049 so i was thinking you might be right .
Ses03F_script02_2_F050 maybe this is the right place after all .
Ses03F_script02_2_F051 i m sorry augie .
Ses03F_script02_2_F052 or not .
Ses03F_script02_2_M000 so what do you think ?
Ses03F_script02_2_M001 about what i was just saying .
Ses03F_script02_2_M002 it certainly is not . it is slightly exaggerated scientific fact .
Ses03F_script02_2_M003 well i m not the only one . look at all these people .
Ses03F_script02_2_M004 are we talking about the same thing ?
Ses03F_script02_2_M005 carla can i ask you something ? don t take this wrong but are you having your period ?
Ses03F_script02_2_M006 okay then what s bugging you ?
Ses03F_script02_2_M007 there s nothing to it alright ? we come down here the grunion arrive they do their little fish business we go ooh ah look at the fish and then they go home and we go home .

Ses03F_script02_2_M009 we missed them twice . that s not ever .
Ses03F_script02_2_M010 we ll see them this time .
Ses03F_script02_2_M011 god i thought you wanted to see it .
Ses03F_script02_2_M012 it s just fish . nothing to get traumatized over .
Ses03F_script02_2_M013 i ve been turning this thing over in my head trying to figure out when the point was when we took a turn for the worse and i can t seem to pinpoint it .
Ses03F_script02_2_M014 you were fine during the phone call from marge . dinner was okay . doing the dishes was no problem . let s see . i took a shower . you were watching the news . you said augie i think the grunion are running . i said great let s go . i feel lucky tonight .
Ses03F_script02_2_M015 and so i m getting the animals putting the animals out in the yard . i m putting on my jacket getting the car out of the garage 
Ses03F_script02_2_M016 wait a minute . i got it .
Ses03F_script02_2_M017 it was driving past the knickerbocker liquor locker right ? you said let s get some champagne and i said time s a wasting or something like that .
Ses03F_script02_2_M018 you want this to be like the other time right ? that s it . right ?
Ses03F_script02_2_M019 right . i got it . of course . listen do you want to dance ?

Ses03F_script02_2_M026 a a back rub some ice cream a suicide pact . what the hell do you want carla ?
Ses03F_script02_2_M027 jesus welcome to the human race .
Ses03F_script02_2_M028 did you think this is how i thought it was going to turn out ? do you think i had some great fantasy down the line ? that four years down the line that we d come to the beach and argue with each other over fish ?
Ses03F_script02_2_M029 no i was just like you . i thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and everything great . and the wind in our hair and the sand in our toes and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves and we ll have three big fat rosy kids . and oh god .
Ses03F_script02_2_M030 you know what you get ? the jokes on us baby . because do you know what you get ? huh ? carla ? do you know what you get ? you get this .
Ses03F_script02_2_M031 yes it is .
Ses03F_script02_2_M032 right .
Ses03F_script02_2_M033 no i know . me neither .
Ses03F_script02_2_M034 well i m doing the best i can .
Ses03F_script02_2_M035 yeah maybe if you were with someone else too .
Ses03F_script02_2_M036 no i know . but i know i don t make you happy .
Ses03F_script02_2_M037 yeah ?
Ses03F_script02_2_M038 actually now that you mention it no i don t .
Ses03F_script02_2_M039 seemed like a pretty good spot to me . i mean look at the view of the moon we ve got from here .
Ses03F_script02_2_M040 look what we got here .
Ses03F_script02_2_M041 it s not champagne .
Ses03F_script02_2_M042 are you still cold ? do you want to go home ?
Ses03F_script02_2_M043 shh .
Ses03F_script02_2_M044 if we re very quiet the fish might come .
Ses03F_script02_2_M045 or not .
Ses03M_script02_1_F000 fine .
Ses03M_script02_1_F001 what flashlight ?
Ses03M_script02_1_F002 it s not your flashlight .

Ses03M_script02_1_F004 well you keep saying it s my flashlight like it s only your flashlight . i mean how do you think that makes me feel ?
Ses03M_script02_1_F005 yes .
Ses03M_script02_1_F006 look i m cold .
Ses03M_script02_1_F007 it s past eleven let s go .
Ses03M_script02_1_F008 there is no point in coming down here .
Ses03M_script02_1_F009 that s my point .
Ses03M_script02_1_F010 so let s go .
Ses03M_script02_1_F011 not particularly .
Ses03M_script02_1_F012 i don t know . i just don t .
Ses03M_script02_1_F013 pass up what ? these fish swim up to shore on the beach and then they flop around a little they swim away and then they die .
Ses03M_script02_1_F014 what are you getting so excited about ? i mean it s not like it s like the landing on the moon or something . i mean it s just fish fish that nobody eats .
Ses03M_script02_1_F015 augie .
Ses03M_script02_1_F016 i m just not .
Ses03M_script02_1_F017 yes .
Ses03M_script02_1_F018 you also could remember that i got sand in my panties we got in an argument over nothing you got a sore throat and we didn t even get to see the grunions .
Ses03M_script02_1_F019 you didn t see them the first time either .
Ses03M_script02_1_F020 that s the wind .
Ses03M_script02_1_F021 about what ?
Ses03M_script02_1_F022 it s ridiculous .
Ses03M_script02_1_M000 hey what time is it ? this pokes around midnight right ? god this is great isn t it ?
Ses03M_script02_1_M001 look at the night we got . i wouldn t trade this for anything .
Ses03M_script02_1_M002 you know actually i wanted to go a little further up the coast and get away from all the lights and people but i was afraid you d miss it . how are you doing ?
Ses03M_script02_1_M003 is that is that nah is that just paul ? i can t even tell .
Ses03M_script02_1_M004 but if i can t tell it probably isn t them isn t it ? probably would be unmistakable wouldn t you think ? how are you doing ?
Ses03M_script02_1_M005 oh you know what i forgot ? i forgot my flashlight . how could i be so stupid ? i should ve brought my flashlight .
Ses03M_script02_1_M006 you know the flashlight the silver one ? there s only one isn t there ?
Ses03M_script02_1_M007 well whose is it ?
Ses03M_script02_1_M008 well sure .
Ses03M_script02_1_M009 no . of course our flashlight . yours and mine . me flashlight is su flashlight naturally .
Ses03M_script02_1_M010 how could we have not thought to bring it ? i hope the moon stays out .
Ses03M_script02_1_M011 was it a full moon last year when they were running ? i can t remember . do you remember ?
Ses03M_script02_1_M012 are you cold ? do you want my jacket ?
Ses03M_script02_1_M013 we should ve brought the blanket our blanket .
Ses03M_script02_1_M014 god . oh you know what would be good right about now ? a six pack . a six pack would be just the ticket .
Ses03M_script02_1_M015 i m so stupid i should ve brought a six pack . god i m like a little kid . it s amazing i get out of the house with my fly zipped up . oh laughter 
Ses03M_script02_1_M016 i wonder if they can hear us talk ? or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around ?
Ses03M_script02_1_M017 do you want my jacket ?
Ses03M_script02_1_M018 what ? are you kidding me ? we just got here . we miss it . what s the point of coming down here if we just turn around and go home ?
Ses03M_script02_1_M019 right .
Ses03M_script02_1_M020 that s my point too . . .no . no . that s not my point . my point is what s the point if we come down here if we just turn around and leave ?
Ses03M_script02_1_M021 i mean don t you want to see it ?
Ses03M_script02_1_M022 why not ?
Ses03M_script02_1_M023 honey this is a natural phenomenon . it only happens once a year . i mean think about the people in kansas they would have to get hotel reservations and plane tickets to come and see this . we re only forty minutes away . this is too good to pass up .
Ses03M_script02_1_M024 well this is like the highlight the one night of their lives and that flopping around that s laying eggs or spawning or mating or whatever you call it .
Ses03M_script02_1_M025 but this is the big night for these guys . their last life s last orgy .
Ses03M_script02_1_M026 yeah they do .
Ses03M_script02_1_M027 okay . but it s fish that do something that no other fish do . like the swallows in capistrano or the lemmings that throw themselves off the cliffs there s magic here and some mystery and a little bit of unexplainable .
Ses03M_script02_1_M028 i mean i can t see how you can not be interested .
Ses03M_script02_1_M029 for real ?
Ses03M_script02_1_M030 i don t get it . i mean the first time we came to see it you said it was the best night of your life .
Ses03M_script02_1_M031 and last year when we came you ran out of the house so fast you stubbed your toe and you didn t even notice it until we got in the car .
Ses03M_script02_1_M032 okay . we re in a good spot .
Ses03M_script02_1_M033 we just weren t in the good spot . this is a much better spot . you know i have a good instincts for these things .
Ses03M_script02_1_M034 look is that . . .no is that just seaweed ?
Ses03M_script02_1_M035 you know this is great isn t it ? you know i wouldn t trade this for anything .
Ses03M_script02_1_M036 i mean think about this i know you re not interested but just think about this for a minute .
Ses03M_script02_1_M037 somewhere out there there s this huge silver mass of fish heading this way they don t why we don t know why they just some little instinctual fire cracker went off in their bodies . . .
Ses03M_script02_1_M038  . . .like and they all just turned at once and formed a line as long as the california coast and started swimming this way . they didn t you know they didn t make a decision they didn t you know have boats or anything . no one sent them an invitation or a map they just started swimming as if that s the only thing that matters .
Ses03M_script02_1_M039 it s single mindedness with no mind . it s urgency that s pure urge and they don t they don t ask it a question they don t give it a name they just swim .
Ses03M_script02_1_M040 they just start swimming to this place right here where we stand for massive celebration of sex and death .
Ses03M_script02_1_M041 oh i m giving myself goose bumps . look all my hairs are standing up .
Ses03M_script02_1_M042  breathing so what do you think ?
Ses03M_script02_1_M043 about what i just said ?
Ses03M_script02_1_M044 it certainly is not . it s
Ses03F_impro05_F000 look sir i ve been waiting for about an hour and my luggage still hasn t come . what s going on ?

Ses03F_impro05_F005 wait sir . you re you re completely not what do you mean stole it ? how can they just steal it from an airplane ? it was up in the air ?
Ses03F_impro05_F006 okay . all i know is that i am supposed to have my language here right now . right now . and it s not there . and you re supposed to help me because you work at the airport . so give me my luggage or tell me where the hell it is .

Ses03F_impro05_F010 fifteen percent ?
Ses03F_impro05_F011 what ? there there s hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of stuff in there .
Ses03F_impro05_F012 no no no . you don t understand . this is these are my belongings in the luggage . and i went to paris .
Ses03F_impro05_F013 sir why are you laughing at me ? this isn t funny .
Ses03F_impro05_F014 well i m sorry if i no it s not stupid . you are supposed to have my luggage .
Ses03F_impro05_F015 no they said i couldn t lock it .

Ses03F_impro05_M002 maybe it got lost . did you think about that mom ?
Ses03F_impro05_M003 oh not we didn t lose it maybe the airport lost it . maybe someone stole it .
Ses03F_impro05_M004 no i mean maybe in the little going around thingy thing where bopper stole it from there .
Ses03F_impro05_M005 okay . what can we do is we can get your name and information and if it shows up we can send it to you so wherever you stay
Ses03F_impro05_M006 well i ll have you fill out some paperwork and see if you can get started on something .
Ses03F_impro05_M007 you know we ll file a complaint and we could possibly you know replace some of the things . i think 
Ses03F_impro05_M008 and when you sign your ticket we could replace about fifteen percent of what s in the bag .
Ses03F_impro05_M009 up to a limit of twenty five dollars .
Ses03F_impro05_M010 whoa maybe you should uh have thought of a better way to send it than just in a bag hmm ? did you think about that ?
Ses03F_impro05_M011 i think that s kind of stupid that you put a hundred thousands of dollars in the bag .
Ses03F_impro05_M012 did you lock did you lock it even ? you probably didn t even lock it .
Ses03F_impro05_M013 okay let me get him .oh guess who the supervisor is ? it s me .

Ses03M_script03_1_F028  laughter yeah . that was the first time you ever hit me .

Ses03F_script02_1_M001 look at the night we got couldn t be better .
Ses03F_script02_1_M002 you know actually i wanted to go a little further up the coast to get away from all the the people and the lights and uh but i thought we d miss it . hey how you doing ?
Ses03F_script02_1_M003 oh is that is that now is that just foam uhh i can t even tell .
Ses03F_script02_1_M004 oh though if i can t tell it probably isn t them right ? it probably would be unmistakable wouldn t you think ? hey how you doing ?

Ses03F_script02_1_M009 we should have brought our flashlight . i can t believe we forgot to bring it .
Ses03F_script02_1_M010 i hope the moon stays out .
Ses03F_script02_1_M011 hey do they always run during a full moon ? i can t remember if it was full last year . do you remember ?
Ses03F_script02_1_M012 are you cold ? do you want my jacket ?
Ses03F_script02_1_M013 we should have brought the blanket . oh why didn t we bring the blanket ? our blanket .
Ses03F_script02_1_M014 you know what would be good right now ? a six pack . ah i can t believe i forgot a six pack . a six pack would be just the ticket right about now .
Ses03F_script02_1_M015 i m so stupid . i m like a little kid . i it s amazing i get out of the house with my fly zipped . oh laughter .
Ses03F_script02_1_M016 i wonder if they can hear us talk . or hear the vibrations in the sand when we move .
Ses03F_script02_1_M017 do you want my jacket ?
Ses03F_script02_1_M018 what ? are you kidding me ? we just got here . we d miss it . what s the point of coming down there if we just turn around and go home ?
Ses03F_script02_1_M019 right .
Ses03F_script02_1_M020 yeah that s my point too .
Ses03F_script02_1_M021 no . no no no that s not my point . my point is there s no point in coming down here if we just turn around and leave .
Ses03F_script02_1_M022 i mean don t you want to see it ?
Ses03F_script02_1_M023 why not ?
Ses03F_script02_1_M024 honey this is a natural this is a natural phenomenon . i mean it only happens once a year . this is this is a great opportunity . think about the people in kansas . they would have to get a plane ticket and hotel reservation to come and see this . we re only forty minutes away . this is too good to pass up .
Ses03F_script02_1_M025 yeah . but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives . and all that flopping around is laying eggs or what you spawning or mating or something like that .
Ses03F_script02_1_M026 i mean this is the big night for these guys . life s last orgy .
Ses03F_script02_1_M027 yeah they do .
Ses03F_script02_1_M028 what okay then it s fish that do something no other fish do . like the swallows in capistrano or the lemmings who throw themselves off the cliffs .
Ses03F_script02_1_M029 there s magic here and mystery and a little bit of the unexplainable . i mean i don t see how you cannot be interested .
Ses03F_script02_1_M030 for real ?
Ses03F_script02_1_M031 i don t get it . the last time the first time that we came to see it you said it was the best night of your life .
Ses03F_script02_1_M032 and then last year when we came to see it you ran out of the house so fast that you stubbed your toe . and you didn t even notice until you got in the car .
Ses03F_script02_1_M033 we weren t in a good spot .
Ses03F_script02_1_M034 we just weren t in a good spot all right ? this is a much better spot . i have a good instinct for these things . look is that 
Ses03F_script02_1_M035 no that s just seaweed isn t it ? this is great isn t it ?
Ses03F_script02_1_M036 i wouldn t miss this for anything . i mean think about this . okay i know you re not interested but just think about this for a minute .
Ses03F_script02_1_M037 somewhere out there there s this huge silver mass of fish heading this way . they don t know why . and we don t know why . just some little instinctual time release firecracker went off went off in their bodies .
Ses03F_script02_1_M038 and they all all as one turned as one and formed this line as big as the california coast and started swimming this way . swimming as if that s the only thing that matters .
Ses03F_script02_1_M039 you know they didn t ask it a question . they didn t they didn t take a vote . they didn t have an invitation or a map they just started swimming as one .
Ses03F_script02_1_M040 its single mindedness with one mind . urgency that s pure urge . you know they don t give it a name .
Ses03F_script02_1_M041 they don t ask it a question . they just they just they don t know what drives them . they just turn as one and start the swim that brings them to here
Ses03F_script02_1_M042 where we stand for a massive celebration of sex and death . oh god i m giving myself goosebumps . look i m all all my hairs on my arms is sticking up .
Ses03F_script02_1_M043 so what do you think ?
Ses03F_script02_1_M044 about what i just said .
Ses03F_script03_2_F000 you knew there was nothing in that .
Ses03F_script03_2_F001 presents ? it was only a small trivial little broach .
Ses03F_script03_2_F002 not at all . it was very pretty . and i wear it all the time . i still have it .
Ses03F_script03_2_F003 no i didn t . you made that up all in your jealous imagination .
Ses03F_script03_2_F004 just a little perhaps but it was nothing serious .
Ses03F_script03_2_F005 well what of it ?
Ses03F_script03_2_F006 oh come on it gave him a lot of pleasure and it didn t harm me .
Ses03F_script03_2_F007 well if you hadn t been so suspicious and nosey you d have never known anything about it .
Ses03F_script03_2_F008 well it s true .

Ses03F_script03_2_F011 i don t see why you want it you ve already had two glasses .
Ses03F_script03_2_F012 i don t see what s the point of going on and on about something like this .
Ses03F_script03_2_F013 it s become a habit with you .
Ses03F_script03_2_F014 don t be so stupid .
Ses03F_script03_2_F015 what ?
Ses03F_script03_2_F016 no . just making myself fascinating for you .
Ses03F_script03_2_F017 it s a woman s job to allure the man . watch me won t you a minute ?
Ses03F_script03_2_F018 no it isn t .
Ses03F_script03_2_F019 no it s not . i don t care .
Ses03F_script03_2_F020 well it didn t seem to do such wonders with you now did it ?
Ses03F_script03_2_F021 adders don t snap they sting .
Ses03F_script03_2_F022 they sting .
Ses03F_script03_2_F023 i don t care . i don t care do you understand ? i don t care if they bark if they roll over on the floor like hoops .
Ses03F_script03_2_F024 yes i did quite a lot actually .
Ses03F_script03_2_F025 mind your business .
Ses03F_script03_2_F026 you are quite insufferable . i suppose it s because you re drunk .
Ses03F_script03_2_F027 you ve always had a weak head .
Ses03F_script03_2_F028 on the contrary a child of two can get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy .
Ses03F_script03_2_F029 do shut up . shut up .
Ses03F_script03_2_F030 i don t want to talk about this anymore .
Ses03F_script03_2_F031 why ?

Ses03F_script03_2_F033 they re away in tunis .
Ses03F_script03_2_F034 turn it on again please .
Ses03F_script03_2_F035 turn it on .
Ses03F_script03_2_F036 you ve always had far too temperamental for yourself . you should try to control it .
Ses03F_script03_2_F037 i will not . go away . go away . i hate you .
Ses03F_script03_2_F038 listen indeed . no no no no . i am sick and tired of listening to you you sadistic bully .
Ses03F_script03_2_F039 stop it stop it i hate you i loath you you are overbearing and conceited and utterly impossible .
Ses03F_script03_2_F040 this is the end . do you hear ? the end . now and forever .
Ses03F_script03_2_F041 oh yes i am .
Ses03F_script03_2_F042 yes i am . let go of me . i hate you and i loath you . god i can t believe i just finally realized how you are . i am never marry you . never . never never never . i would rather die in torment .
Ses03F_script03_2_F043 beast or brute cad swine beast beast brute .
Ses03F_script03_2_M000 as a matter of fact the real cause of that row was peter burden .
Ses03F_script03_2_M001 i knew nothing of the sort . you took presents from him .
Ses03F_script03_2_M002 i remember it well . bristling with diamonds . in the worst possible taste .
Ses03F_script03_2_M003 you went out of your way to torture me over peter burden .
Ses03F_script03_2_M004 you must admit that he was in love with you .
Ses03F_script03_2_M005 you let him kiss you . you said so .
Ses03F_script03_2_M006 what of it ?
Ses03F_script03_2_M007 what about me ?
Ses03F_script03_2_M008 that s a nice point of view i must say .
Ses03F_script03_2_M009 are you bored with this conversation ?
Ses03F_script03_2_M010 so am i . bored stiff . want some brandy ?
Ses03F_script03_2_M011 i ll have a little i think .
Ses03F_script03_2_M012 no particular reason . anyhow they were very small ones .
Ses03F_script03_2_M013 oh my you can hardly call three minute liquor glasses in the evening going on and on and on .
Ses03F_script03_2_M014 you needn t be so grand just because you don t happen to want some yourself at the moment .
Ses03F_script03_2_M015 really amanda .
Ses03F_script03_2_M016 nothing .
Ses03F_script03_2_M017 going somewhere dear ?
Ses03F_script03_2_M018 that reply has broken my heart .
Ses03F_script03_2_M019 as a matter of fact that s perfectly true .
Ses03F_script03_2_M020 yes it is .
Ses03F_script03_2_M021 it s a pity you didn t have more brandy . it might have made you a little less disagreeable .
Ses03F_script03_2_M022 oh snap snap snap like a little adder .
Ses03F_script03_2_M023 yes they do . they have a big bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap .
Ses03F_script03_2_M024 they snap .
Ses03F_script03_2_M025 uhh 
Ses03F_script03_2_M026 did you see much of peter burden after our divorce ?

Ses03M_script01_3_M012 i m embarrassing you . i didn t want to tell you this here . i wanted to drive someplace brand new where we d be brand new to each other . it feels wrong here don t you ?
Ses03M_script01_3_M013 this yard and this chair . i don t want to win you from anything i want you to be ready for me .
Ses03M_script01_3_M014 then he s gone forever you sure ?
Ses03M_script01_3_M015 why didn t you ?
Ses03M_script01_3_M016 you felt something that far back .

Ses03M_script01_3_M018 give me a kiss ann just give me . . .
Ses03M_script01_3_M019 oh god . annie i kissed annie . i kissed annie .
Ses03M_script01_3_M020 how long how long i ve been waiting to do that .
Ses03M_script01_3_M021 we re going to live now . i m going to make you so happy .
Ses03M_script01_3_M022 i kissed you .
Ses03M_script01_3_M023 nothing . hey let s drive somewhere . i want to be alone with you .
Ses03M_script01_3_M024 no nothing nothing like that .
Ses03M_script01_3_M025 well yes i guess i ve been ashamed but it s going from me .
Ses03M_script01_3_M026 i don t know where to start .
Ses03M_script01_3_M027 you remember overseas i was in command of a company ?
Ses03M_script01_3_M028 well i lost them .
Ses03M_script01_3_M029 just about all .
Ses03M_script01_3_M030 takes a little while to toss that off cause they weren t just men .
Ses03M_script01_3_M031 for instance one time this . . .it had been raining several days and this one kid he came up to me he gave me his last pair of dry socks put them in my pocket .
Ses03M_script01_3_M032 that s just a little thing but that s the kind of guys i had . they didn t just die they killed themselves for each other and i mean that exactly .
Ses03M_script01_3_M033 a little more selfish and they d still be here today . and i got this idea watching them go down . see everything was being destroyed but there was one new thing that was being created .
Ses03M_script01_3_M034 it was a kind of responsibility man for man . you understand me ?
Ses03M_script01_3_M035 and to show that and to bring that onto the earth again like some sort of monument standing right behind all of us and we could feel it and it would make a difference to him .
Ses03M_script01_3_M036 and then i came here and it was incredible . there was no meaning in it here . the whole thing to them was a kind of bus accident .
Ses03M_script01_3_M037 and i went to work with dad and that rat race again and i felt what you said ashamed . somehow because nobody was changed at all .
Ses03M_script01_3_M038 it seemed to make a sucker out of a lot of guys . i felt wrong to be alive . i felt wrong to have that new checkbook 
Ses03M_script01_3_M039 open that new bank account drive the new car and see the new refrigerator
Ses03M_script01_3_M040 cause you can take those things out of the war . but you got to know when you drive that car that it came out of the love that a man can have for a man and you got to be a little bit better because of that .
Ses03M_script01_3_M041 otherwise what you have is loot and there s blood on it .
Ses03M_script01_3_M042 and i didn t want to take any of it and i guess that included you .

Ses03M_script01_1_F019 well that s your business chris .
Ses03M_script01_1_F020 well what do you want me to do ? i mean you re old enough to know your own mind .
Ses03M_script01_1_F021 well i mean you got to make sure your dad s not going 
Ses03M_script01_1_F022 well i m just saying 
Ses03M_script01_1_F023 you know i ignore what i got to ignore .
Ses03M_script01_1_F024 she s not . . .she s larry s girl .
Ses03M_script01_1_F025 from your father s point of view he is still alive and if you try and take her that s just not fair . you can t do that .
Ses03M_script01_1_F026 and and and if you go on from there if you know already to go on from there then you can . but i m telling you something that i don t know where to go . you got it ? i mean do you ?
Ses03M_script01_1_F027 you re a considerate fellow . there is nothing wrong in that .
Ses03M_script01_1_F028 did you ask annie yet ?
Ses03M_script01_1_F029 and what if she doesn t marry you huh ? what if she feels the same way your father does ?
Ses03M_script01_1_F030 look you never had seen many many women . you know ? i mean . . .
Ses03M_script01_1_F031 well i just don t see why it has to be annie .
Ses03M_script01_1_F032 well that s a good answer but it doesn t answer anything . you haven t seen her since you left to go to the war and it s been five years .
Ses03M_script01_1_F033 no i don t want a diagram .
Ses03M_script01_1_F034 he thinks he s coming back . and you go off and marry that girl and you re just pronouncing him dead and what s going to happen to him ? i don t know . do you ? i mean i don t know .
Ses03M_script01_1_F035 look just give it some thought okay ?
Ses03M_script01_1_F036 what the hell is this ?
Ses03M_script01_1_F037 are you crazy ?
Ses03M_script01_1_F038 you re just going to leave the business ? you have a business here . you can t do that .
Ses03M_script01_1_F039 oh you have to be inspired .
Ses03M_script01_1_F040 tell me something . you can leave this business ?
Ses03M_script01_1_F041 you can t talk like that .
Ses03M_script01_1_F042 alright but you can t talk like that you hear ?
Ses03M_script01_1_F043 i mean what the hell have we worked for then ? i mean it s all for you chris . the whole shooting match is for you .
Ses03M_script01_1_F044 alright but you don t talk like that you hear ? you don t .
Ses03M_script01_1_F045 i don t understand you do i ?
Ses03M_script01_1_F046 yeah . i can see that .
Ses03M_script01_1_M000 he saw it .
Ses03M_script01_1_M001 he was out there when it happened .
Ses03M_script01_1_M002 about four in the morning . i heard a crack and i looked out and he was standing right there when it happened .
Ses03M_script01_1_M003 i don t know . but after it cracked he ran back into the house and he cried in the kitchen .
Ses03M_script01_1_M004 no . i figured the best thing to do was leave him alone .
Ses03M_script01_1_M005 i could hear it right through the floor .
Ses03M_script01_1_M006 i guess he is .
Ses03M_script01_1_M007 i don t know . but i know one thing mom we made a terrible mistake with dad .
Ses03M_script01_1_M008 being dishonest with him . that kind of thing always pays off and now it s paying off .
Ses03M_script01_1_M009 you know that larry s not coming back and i know that too . why we both go on letting him think that we both believe with him .
Ses03M_script01_1_M010 no i don t want to argue with him but it s time that he realizes that nobody believes larry s coming back anymore .
Ses03M_script01_1_M011 why shouldn t he walk around and dream at him at night . walk around . why shouldn t he walk around ? why shouldn t he dream of him walk around at night waiting for him ? do we contradict him ? do we say flat out that we don t have anymore hope ?
Ses03M_script01_1_M012 that we haven t had any hope for years now ?
Ses03M_script01_1_M013 we got to say it to him .
Ses03M_script01_1_M014 larry s been gone for three years . for god sakes no one comes back after three years . it s insane .
Ses03M_script01_1_M015 listen mom just sit down . i want to talk to you .
Ses03M_script01_1_M016 alright . alright . alright just listen .
Ses03M_script01_1_M017 you know why i asked annie here right ?
Ses03M_script01_1_M018 you know .
Ses03M_script01_1_M019 i want to ask her to marry me .
Ses03M_script01_1_M020 you know it s not just my business .
Ses03M_script01_1_M021 okay . so then it s alright . i ll go ahead with it .
Ses03M_script01_1_M022 oh see then it s just not my business . god you infuriate me sometimes . isn t my business too if dad throws a fit ? huh ? god you have such a talent for ignoring things .
Ses03M_script01_1_M023 she s not larry s girl .
Ses03M_script01_1_M024 i don t know why it is but every time i reach out for something i want i have to pull back
Ses03M_script01_1_M025 because other people will suffer .
Ses03M_script01_1_M026 my whole entire bloody life time and time again .
Ses03M_script01_1_M027 well to hell with that .
Ses03M_script01_1_M028 i wanted to get this settled first .
Ses03M_script01_1_M029 then i guess that s the end of it .
Ses03M_script01_1_M030 but from her letters i think she s forgotten him . i ll find out .
Ses03M_script01_1_M031 and then we ll thrash it out with dad right ? mom don t avoid me .
Ses03M_script01_1_M032 well so what ? i m just not fast with women .
Ses03M_script01_1_M033 because it is .
Ses03M_script01_1_M034 it s just . . .that s just the way it is . that s how i feel . you know these years when i think of someone i want to marry i think of annie . what do you want a diagram ?
Ses03M_script01_1_M035 alright then .
Ses03M_script01_1_M036 i ve given it three years of thought and i thought that if i waited then dad would forget about larry and then we could have a regular wedding and everything happy .
Ses03M_script01_1_M037 but if i can t have that here i ll get out .
Ses03M_script01_1_M038 i ll get out . i ll marry her somewhere else . maybe new york .
Ses03M_script01_1_M039 i ve been a good son too long . a good sucker and i m through with it .
Ses03M_script01_1_M040 the business doesn t inspire me .
Ses03M_script01_1_M041 yes . i like it an hour out of the day . if i have to grub for money all day long at least at evening i want it beautiful . i want a family . i want a wife . i want some kids . i want to build something i can give myself to .

Ses04M_impro05_M030 but your job is not my concern . my concern is getting my luggage .
Ses04M_impro05_M031 look i don t look can we just not argue about this . like

Ses04M_impro05_M041 but that s not going to but you don t understand . you re looking forward to never seeing me again .
Ses04M_impro05_M042 but never seeing me again is not going to happen until you give me the three checks .
Ses04M_impro05_M043 i don t i m not i m not convinced .
Ses04M_impro05_M044 yeah . if you were really sorry you d give me the three checks .
Ses04M_impro05_M045 so why don t we just do that and stop this nonsense hmm ? hmm ?
Ses04M_impro04_F000 well there has to be something you haven t tried .
Ses04M_impro04_F001 what about like a temp agency ?
Ses04M_impro04_F002 have you gone like signed up with a temp agency ? maybe they can help .
Ses04M_impro04_F003 right but you have i mean you have to keep on them . you have to keep calling and reminding them that you re still looking and
Ses04M_impro04_F004 i mean you have to be really aggressive about it .
Ses04M_impro04_F005 well i mean if it s that bad maybe you re gonna have to take something that doesn t really fit you know . like maybe you ll have to do something else for a while . find a new field new skill .
Ses04M_impro04_F006 well then you re choosing to be unemployed really .
Ses04M_impro04_F007 if you re not willing to try and work with it and find something and you know i mean there are things you could do .
Ses04M_impro04_F008 well maybe you know your luck it is just down and the market for your particular field is down and maybe you just need to look into doing something else for a while .
Ses04M_impro04_F009 i mean i m not saying that you should you know 
Ses04M_impro04_F010 excuse me ?
Ses04M_impro04_F011 it s my fault cause you didn t do what i told you to ?
Ses04M_impro04_F012 well that sounds like your fault .
Ses04M_impro04_F013 you didn t do what i told you to do .
Ses04M_impro04_F014 that s amazing logic that you managed to turn that around and make it my fault .
Ses04M_impro04_F015 i think maybe you can t get employed because you aren t willing to take responsibility for your own actions .
Ses04M_impro04_F016 really ? whose fault is it you don t have a job ?
Ses04M_impro04_F017  laughter 
Ses04M_impro04_F018 you see what you just did there though ?
Ses04M_impro04_M000 oh man i just i don t know what to do . i don t know what to do . it s like every job you know i go to every job i apply to 
Ses04M_impro04_M001 it s just like nobody nobody wants to hire me . it s been years i mean do you understand years ? like i m you know what i mean it s like i ve been collecting unemployment for so long now it s just like i just i can t take it . i don t know what to do . i mean i m just like losing my mind .
Ses04M_impro04_M002 i i m not kidding . i ve tried everything . like i ve gone to every business and local you know 
Ses04M_impro04_M003 local business in in the area and i can t i can t get anything . like nobody 
Ses04M_impro04_M004 there s just like no jobs available . i mean it s just like god .
Ses04M_impro04_M005 yeah i tried that . and there was like yeah like i did like one thing once . but like that s not it doesn t last very long . and it s not enough to live on .
Ses04M_impro04_M006 yeah i do . i do . you don t understand .
Ses04M_impro04_M007 i you don t understand . i don t have a job . all my job is to look for a job . i don t do anything else .
Ses04M_impro04_M008 but like it s been years now and i just can t seem to get anything that really fits . it s just it i it drives me absolutely insane .
Ses04M_impro04_M009 no no no no no . i can t i can t do that . i can t i because if i m not if i m not if i m not doing something that i love then i can t i can t i mean it s what s the point ?
Ses04M_impro04_M010 i m not choosing . i m not 
Ses04M_impro04_M011 no but i m try but like all the things that i it s like i apply to all these places and none of them
Ses04M_impro04_M012  i mean i don t understand . it s like i mean i feel like i m qualified enough . i just don t understand . like i mean it s just like a matter of circumstance but it s been three years you know three years .
Ses04M_impro04_M013 this is stupid .
Ses04M_impro04_M014 you know what this is your fault .
Ses04M_impro04_M015 it s your fault cause cause you always told me to to do this and i did that instead . and i didn t take your advice and and but you sort of were like were telling 
Ses04M_impro04_M016 yeah exactly .
Ses04M_impro04_M017 yeah .
Ses04M_impro04_M018 that s cause you always tell me to do the wrong thing . and i thought this time it was i was gonna be right by going with the opposite thing . so it s your fault because
Ses04M_impro04_M019  because you were always wrong and and and this time you were right . and and i didn t yeah that s why .
Ses04M_impro04_M020 well i mean it makes sense doesn t it hmm ?
Ses04M_impro04_M021 that s not true . i take responsibility for my own actions .

Ses04F_script03_1_F007 certainly i shall probably do a court curtsy .
Ses04F_script03_1_F008 what is so horrible is that one can t stay happy .
Ses04F_script03_1_F009 it s true the whole business is very poor joke .

Ses04F_script03_1_F014 oh how long will it last this ludicrous over bearing love of ours ?
Ses04F_script03_1_F015 we always want to bicker and fight .
Ses04F_script03_1_F016 oh dear shall we like that ?
Ses04F_script03_1_F017 what happens if one of us dies ? does the one that s left still laugh ?

Ses04F_script03_1_F024 yes i know you did . you threw him out of the window into the grand canal . i don t think i ll ever forgive you for that .
Ses04F_script03_1_F025 it went on intermittently for days .
Ses04F_script03_1_F026 it burnt my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom .
Ses04F_script03_1_F027 that was the first time you ever hit me .
Ses04F_script03_1_F028 then the manager came in and found us rolling about on the floor biting and scratching like panthers .
Ses04F_script03_1_F029 how ridiculous . how utterly utterly ridiculous .
Ses04F_script03_1_F030 and very much sillier .
Ses04F_script03_1_M000 good god .
Ses04F_script03_1_M001 i wonder .

Ses04F_script03_1_M007 with the most perfect poise .
Ses04F_script03_1_M008 things that ought to matter dreadfully don t matter at all when one s happy do they ?
Ses04F_script03_1_M009 don t say that my darling .
Ses04F_script03_1_M010 meaning that sacred and beautiful thing love .
Ses04F_script03_1_M011 what does it all mean ? that s what i asked myself in my ceaseless quest for ultimate truth . dear god what does it all mean ?
Ses04F_script03_1_M012 you mustn t be serious my darling . it s just what they want .
Ses04F_script03_1_M013 all the futile moralists who try to make life unbearable .
Ses04F_script03_1_M014 laugh at them be flippant laugh at everything all their sacred shibboleths
Ses04F_script03_1_M015 flippancy brings out the acid in their damn sweetness and light .
Ses04F_script03_1_M016 certainly you must . we are figures of fun alright .
Ses04F_script03_1_M017 well who knows ?
Ses04F_script03_1_M018 no that fire will fade long with our passion .
Ses04F_script03_1_M019 it all depends on how well we ve played .
Ses04F_script03_1_M020 yes . yes . with all his might .
Ses04F_script03_1_M021 no no it isn t . death is very laughable such a cunning little mystery . all done with mirrors .
Ses04F_script03_1_M022 so is everyone else in the long run . let s be superficial and pity the poor philosophers .
Ses04F_script03_1_M023 let s blow trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as much as we can like small quite idiotic little school children .
Ses04F_script03_1_M024 let s savor the delight of the moment . come and kiss me darling before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets .
Ses04F_script03_1_M025 i don t mind what you do see . you can paint yourself green all over
Ses04F_script03_1_M026 and dance naked in the place place vendome and rush away with all the men in the world and i shan t say a word as long as you love me best .
Ses04F_script03_1_M027 do you remember that awful scene in venice ?
Ses04F_script03_1_M028 the one where you bought that little painted wooden snake and put it on my bed .
Ses04F_script03_1_M029 horrible thing . i hated it .
Ses04F_script03_1_M030 how long did that row last ?
Ses04F_script03_1_M031 the worst one was in cannes when your curling irons burnt holes in my dressing gown .
Ses04F_script03_1_M032 ah we were much younger then . that was a rouser wasn t it ?
Ses04F_script03_1_M033 you didn t hit me i didn t hit you very hard .

Ses04F_script01_3_F000 you re the only one i know who loves his parents .
Ses04F_script01_3_F001 it s okay . it s a good thing .
Ses04F_script01_3_F002 you know it s lovely here . the air is sweet .
Ses04F_script01_3_F003 not sorry no but i m not staying .
Ses04F_script01_3_F004 in the first place your mother as much as told me to go .
Ses04F_script01_3_F005 you saw that and you you ve been kind of 
Ses04F_script01_3_F006 well kind of embarrassed ever since i got here .
Ses04F_script01_3_F007 i knew they would your mother anyway .
Ses04F_script01_3_F008 from her point of view why else would i come ?
Ses04F_script01_3_F009 i guess this is why i came .
Ses04F_script01_3_F010 chris i ve been ready a long long time .
Ses04F_script01_3_F011 i almost got married two years ago .
Ses04F_script01_3_F012 you started to write me .
Ses04F_script01_3_F013 every day since .
Ses04F_script01_3_F014 i was waiting for you chris . till then you never wrote and then when you did what did you say . i mean you sure can be ambiguous you know .
Ses04F_script01_3_F015 i ll never forgive you . why did you wait all these years ? all i ve done is sit and wonder if i was crazy for thinking of you .
Ses04F_script01_3_F016 not like that you re not .
Ses04F_script01_3_F017 like larry s brother . do it like you chris .
Ses04F_script01_3_F018 what is it chris ?
Ses04F_script01_3_F019 no . what is it chris your mother ?
Ses04F_script01_3_F020 well then what s wrong ? even in your letters there was something ashamed .
Ses04F_script01_3_F021 you ve got to tell me .
Ses04F_script01_3_F022 it wouldn t work this way .
Ses04F_script01_3_F023 yeah sure .
Ses04F_script01_3_F024 how many ?
Ses04F_script01_3_F025 oh gees .
Ses04F_script01_3_F026 and do you still feel that way ?
Ses04F_script01_3_F027 because you mustn t feel that way anymore because you have a right to whatever you have chris do you understand everything
Ses04F_script01_3_F028 that includes me . and your money there s nothing wrong in your money . your father put hundreds of planes in the air .
Ses04F_script01_3_F029 you should be proud . a man should be paid for that .
Ses04F_script01_3_F030 what ll i do with a fortune ?
Ses04F_script01_3_M000 i know it went out of style didn t it ?
Ses04F_script01_3_M001 you re not sorry you came .
Ses04F_script01_3_M002 why ?
Ses04F_script01_3_M003 well .
Ses04F_script01_3_M004 what ?
Ses04F_script01_3_M005 the trouble is i planned on sneaking up on you over a period of a week or so but they take it for granted that we re all set .
Ses04F_script01_3_M006 how did you know ?
Ses04F_script01_3_M007 wouldn t you want to ?
Ses04F_script01_3_M008 i guess you know this is why i asked you to come .
Ses04F_script01_3_M009 ann i love you . i love you a great deal . i love you .
Ses04F_script01_3_M010 i have no imagination that s all i know to tell you .
Ses04F_script01_3_M011 i m embarrassing you . i didn t want to tell it to you here . i
Ses04F_script01_3_M012 wanted some place we d never been a place where we d be brand new to each other .
Ses04F_script01_3_M013 you think this is wrong this chair this yard . i want you to be ready for me . i don t want to win you away from anything .
Ses04F_script01_3_M014 and he s gone forever . you re sure ?
Ses04F_script01_3_M015 why didn t you ?
Ses04F_script01_3_M016 you felt something that far back ?
Ses04F_script01_3_M017 ann why didn t you let me know ?
Ses04F_script01_3_M018 give me a kiss ann . give me a god i kissed you .
Ses04F_script01_3_M019 i kissed annie . how long how long i ve been waiting to kiss you .
Ses04F_script01_3_M020 annie we re going to live now . i m going to make you so happy .
Ses04F_script01_3_M021 i kissed you .
Ses04F_script01_3_M022 let s drive some place . i want to be alone with you .
Ses04F_script01_3_M023 no nothing like that .
Ses04F_script01_3_M024 yes . i suppose i have been but it s going from me .
Ses04F_script01_3_M025 i don t know where to start .
Ses04F_script01_3_M026 there s so many things mixed up .
Ses04F_script01_3_M027 you remember overseas i was in command of a company ?
Ses04F_script01_3_M028 well i lost them .
Ses04F_script01_3_M029 just about all .
Ses04F_script01_3_M030 it takes a lot of time to toss that off because they weren t just men .
Ses04F_script01_3_M031 for instance one time it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks .
Ses04F_script01_3_M032 i put them in my pocket . that s only a little thing but these are the kind of guys i had .
Ses04F_script01_3_M033 they didn t die . they killed themselves for each other . i mean that exactly . a little more selfish and they d have been here today .
Ses04F_script01_3_M034 and i got this idea watching them go down . everything was being destroyed see but it seemed to me that there was one new thing that was made
Ses04F_script01_3_M035 a sort of responsibility man for man . you understand me ?
Ses04F_script01_3_M036 and then i came home and it was amazing .
Ses04F_script01_3_M037 there was no meaning in it here .
Ses04F_script01_3_M038 the whole thing to them was sort of a bus accident . then i went to work with father and that whole rat race again .
Ses04F_script01_3_M039 i felt what you said ashamed somehow
Ses04F_script01_3_M040 because nobody was changed at all . it seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys .
Ses04F_script01_3_M041 i felt wrong to be alive to open the new bank book to drive the new car to see the new refrigerator .
Ses04F_script01_3_M042 i mean you can take those things out of war but
Ses04F_script01_3_M043 when you drive the new car you have to know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man . you ve got to be a little better because of that .
Ses04F_script01_3_M044 otherwise what you have is really just loot and there s blood on it . i didn t want to take any of it .
Ses04F_script01_3_M045 i guess that included you .
Ses04F_script01_3_M046 i want you now annie .
Ses04F_script01_3_M047 annie annie i m going to make a fortune for you .
Ses04F_script02_1_F000 fine .
Ses04F_script02_1_F001 what flashlight ?
Ses04F_script02_1_F002 it s not yours .
Ses04F_script02_1_F003 it s ours . it s mine too .
Ses04F_script02_1_F004 you kept saying my flashlight as if it somehow is just yours . how s that supposed to make me feel ?
Ses04F_script02_1_F005 yes .
Ses04F_script02_1_F006 i m cold .
Ses04F_script02_1_F007 it s after eleven let s go home .
Ses04F_script02_1_F008 there is no point in coming down here .
Ses04F_script02_1_F009 that s my point .
Ses04F_script02_1_F010 so let s go home .
Ses04F_script02_1_F011 not particularly .
Ses04F_script02_1_F012 i just don t . it s stupid .
Ses04F_script02_1_F013 pass up what ? these little fish swim onto the beach flop around and then swim away and then they die .
Ses04F_script02_1_F014 what are you so excited about ? this isn t a moon landing we re talking about . it s fish . it s fish nobody even eats .
Ses04F_script02_1_F015 oh augie .
Ses04F_script02_1_F016 i m just not .
Ses04F_script02_1_F017 yes .
Ses04F_script02_1_F018 last year you will also remember our shoes got wet . i got sand in my panties . we got in a big fight over nothing . you got a sore throat and we did not see the grunions .
Ses04F_script02_1_F019 we didn t see them the first time either .
Ses04F_script02_1_F020 that s the wind .
Ses04F_script02_1_F021 about what ?
Ses04F_script02_1_F022 it s ridiculous .
Ses04F_script02_1_M000 what time is it ? they re supposed to run around midnight . this is great isn t it ? look at this night we ve got here . it couldn t be better .
Ses04F_script02_1_M001 actually i wanted to go a little farther up the coast get away from the lights and the people but i was afraid to miss it . how you doing ?
Ses04F_script02_1_M002 is that is that that s just foam isn t it ? i can t even tell
Ses04F_script02_1_M003 although if you can t tell it probably isn t them . it will probably be unmistakable . don t you think ? how you doing ?
Ses04F_script02_1_M004 oh no you know what i did ? i forgot my flashlight . how could i be so stupid i forgot my flashlight .
Ses04F_script02_1_M005 the flashlight the silver one . there s only one isn t there ?
Ses04F_script02_1_M006 whose is it ?
Ses04F_script02_1_M007 well sure .
Ses04F_script02_1_M008 no of course our flashlight yours and mine mi flashlight es su flashlight naturally . how could we not think to bring it ?
Ses04F_script02_1_M009 i hope the moon stays out . i wonder do they always run during a full moon . i can t remember if it was full last year . remember ?
Ses04F_script02_1_M010 are you cold ? do you want my jacket ? we should have brought the blanket our blanket .
Ses04F_script02_1_M011 ah this is great isn t it ? i didn t even think to bring a six pack . a six pack would be just the ticket right about now .
Ses04F_script02_1_M012 i can t believe i forgot . i m like a kid . it s amazing i got out of the house with my fly zipped .
Ses04F_script02_1_M013 oh i wonder if they can hear me talk or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around ?
Ses04F_script02_1_M014 do you want my jacket ?
Ses04F_script02_1_M015 are you kidding ? we d miss it . we just got here . what s the point of coming down here if we just turn around and go home ?
Ses04F_script02_1_M016 right .
Ses04F_script02_1_M017 that s my point too .
Ses04F_script02_1_M018 no no no . that s not my point . my point is is that there s no point in coming down here if we just leave . don t you want to see it ?
Ses04F_script02_1_M019 why not ?
Ses04F_script02_1_M020 honey this is natural phenomenon . i mean this only happens once a year . this is a great opportunity .
Ses04F_script02_1_M021 think about the people in kansas . they d have to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to come see this . we re just forty minutes away . it s too good to pass up .
Ses04F_script02_1_M022 yeah but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives . all that flopping around is laying eggs or what do you spawning or mating something like that .
Ses04F_script02_1_M023 this is the big night for these guys . life s last orgy .
Ses04F_script02_1_M024 yeah they do .
Ses04F_script02_1_M025 okay but it s fish who do something none of the other fish do
Ses04F_script02_1_M026 like the swallows returning to capistrano or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs like that . there s mystery here and magic
Ses04F_script02_1_M027 a little bit of the unexplainable . i don t see how you cannot be interested .
Ses04F_script02_1_M028 for real ?
Ses04F_script02_1_M029 i don t get it . the first time we came here to see it you said it was the best night of your life and last year i remember distinctly you were so excited to get here . you stubbed your toe rushing me out the door and didn t even notice until we were in the car .
Ses04F_script02_1_M030 we weren t in a good spot .
Ses04F_script02_1_M031 we just weren t in a good spot . this is a much better spot .
Ses04F_script02_1_M032 i ve got good instincts for these things . look there . what s that . is that ? is that is that no it s just seaweed isn t it .
Ses04F_script02_1_M033 ah man this is great . i wouldn t miss this for anything . i mean think about this . i know you re not interested but just think about this for a minute .
Ses04F_script02_1_M034 out there someplace there s this huge mass of silver fish heading this way . they don t know why . we don t know why . it wasn t a decision . they didn t take a vote .
Ses04F_script02_1_M035 no one sent them a map or an invitation . just some little instinctual time release firecracker went off in their little bodies and all as one . they turned and formed a line as long as the california coast and started swimming .
Ses04F_script02_1_M036 they re swimming right now as if that s the only thing that matters .
Ses04F_script02_1_M037 it s single mindedness with no mind . urgency that s pure urge .
Ses04F_script02_1_M038 they don t know what drives them . they don t give it a name or ask question . they just turn as one and start the swim that brings them here to this place
Ses04F_script02_1_M039 where we stand for massive celebration of sex and death .
Ses04F_script02_1_M040 ah i m giving myself goose bumps . all my hairs are popping up .
Ses04F_script02_1_M041 well so what do you think ?
Ses04F_script02_1_M042 what i said .
Ses04M_script01_2_F000 why did he invite her here ?
Ses04M_script01_2_F001 why does that bother you ?
Ses04M_script01_2_F002 she s been in new york three and a half years . why all of a sudden 
Ses04M_script01_2_F003 nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see .
Ses04M_script01_2_F004 he s not going to marry her .
Ses04M_script01_2_F005 it s got that about it .
Ses04M_script01_2_F006 what s going on here joe ?
Ses04M_script01_2_F007 now listen kid . now listen .
Ses04M_script01_2_F008 she s not his girl joe . she knows she s not .
Ses04M_script01_2_F009 then why is she still single ? new york is full of men . why hasn t she married ? probably a hundred people told her she s foolish but she s waited .
Ses04M_script01_2_F010 because she knows what i know that s why . she s faithful as a rock . in my worst moments i think of her waiting and i know again that i m right .
Ses04M_script01_2_F011 nobody in this house dares take her faith away joe . strangers might but not his father not his brother .
Ses04M_script01_2_F012 i want you to act like he s coming back both of you . don t think i haven t noticed you since he invited her here . i won t stand for any nonsense .
Ses04M_script01_2_F013 because if he s not coming back i ll kill myself .
Ses04M_script01_2_F014 laugh . laugh at me . but why did that happen the very night that she came here ?
Ses04M_script01_2_F015 she goes to sleep in his bed and his memorial breaks in pieces . look . look at it . joe 
Ses04M_script01_2_F016 believe with me joe . i can t stand all alone
Ses04M_script01_2_F017 only last week a man turned up in detroit missing longer than larry .
Ses04M_script01_2_F018 you above all have got to believe . you .
Ses04M_script01_2_F019 just don t stop believing .
Ses04M_script01_2_F020 i can t help it .
Ses04M_script01_2_M000 oh god line .
Ses04M_script01_2_M001 why does why does that bother you ?
Ses04M_script01_2_M002 well maybe maybe he just wanted to see her .
Ses04M_script01_2_M003 what do you mean ? he grew up next door to the girl all his life . why shouldn t he want to why shouldn t he want to see her again ?
Ses04M_script01_2_M004 don t look at me like that . he didn t tell me anymore than he told you .
Ses04M_script01_2_M005 how do you know he s even thinking about it ?
Ses04M_script01_2_M006 well so what ?
Ses04M_script01_2_M007 line .
Ses04M_script01_2_M008 oh . now listen kid .
Ses04M_script01_2_M009 you can t read her mind .
Ses04M_script01_2_M010 how do you know why she waited ?
Ses04M_script01_2_M011 look it s a nice day . what are we arguing for ?
Ses04M_script01_2_M012 what do you want me to do ? what do you want ?

Ses04M_impro02_M034 you have to . do you understand me ? you have to .
Ses04M_impro02_M035 well i guess we re at a stalemate then aren t we ?
Ses04M_script01_1_F000 what s he going to say ? maybe we ought to tell him before he sees it .
Ses04M_script01_1_F001 how could he see it ? i was the first one up . he was still in bed .
Ses04M_script01_1_F002 when ?
Ses04M_script01_1_F003 what was he doing out here at four in the morning ?
Ses04M_script01_1_F004 did you talk to him ?
Ses04M_script01_1_F005 he cried hard ?
Ses04M_script01_1_F006 what was he doing out here at that hour ? he s dreaming about him again . he s walking around at night .
Ses04M_script01_1_F007 he s getting just like after he died . what s the meaning in that ?
Ses04M_script01_1_F008 what ?
Ses04M_script01_1_F009 what do you mean dishonest ?
Ses04M_script01_1_F010 what do you want to do ? argue with him ?
Ses04M_script01_1_F011 you can t say that to him .
Ses04M_script01_1_F012 how are you going to prove it ? can you prove it ?
Ses04M_script01_1_F013 to you it is and to me but not to him . you can talk yourself blue in the face but there s no body and no grave so where are you ?
Ses04M_script01_1_F014 the trouble is the goddamn newspapers . every month some boy turns up from nowhere so the next boy is going to be larry . so we have to keep 
Ses04M_script01_1_F015 why ?
Ses04M_script01_1_F016 well i ve got an idea but what s the story ?
Ses04M_script01_1_F017 well that s only your business chris .
Ses04M_script01_1_F018 what do you want me to do ? you re old enough to know your own mind .
Ses04M_script01_1_F019 well you want to make sure your father isn t going to have 
Ses04M_script01_1_F020 i m just saying .
Ses04M_script01_1_F021 i ignore what i got to ignore . the girl is larry s girl .
Ses04M_script01_1_F022 from father s point of view he s not dead . and you have no right to take his girl .
Ses04M_script01_1_F023 now you can go on from there if you know where to go . but i m telling you i don t know where to go . see i don t know .
Ses04M_script01_1_F024 now what can i do for you ?
Ses04M_script01_1_F025 you re a considerate fellow . there s nothing wrong in that .
Ses04M_script01_1_F026 did you ask annie yet ?
Ses04M_script01_1_F027 how do you know she ll marry you ? maybe she feels the same way father does .
Ses04M_script01_1_F028 the trouble is you don t see enough women . you never did .
Ses04M_script01_1_F029 i don t see why it has to be annie .
Ses04M_script01_1_F030 well that s a good answer but it don t answer anything . he thinks he s coming back chris . you marry that girl you re pronouncing him dead . now what happens to your father ? do you know ? because i don t .
Ses04M_script01_1_F031 alright then mom .
Ses04M_script01_1_F032 yes we did . do you want to keep going ?
Ses04M_script01_1_F033 just give it some more thought .
Ses04M_script01_1_F034 what the hell is this ?
Ses04M_script01_1_F035 are you crazy ?
Ses04M_script01_1_F036 you ve got a business here . what the hell is this ?
Ses04M_script01_1_F037 must you be inspired ?
Ses04M_script01_1_F038 you mean tell me something . you mean you d really leave the business ?
Ses04M_script01_1_F039 you don t want to think like that .
Ses04M_script01_1_F040 alright . but just don t think like that because what the hell did we work for ? that s all for you chris . the whole shooting match is just for you .
Ses04M_script01_1_F041 but don t think that way you hear me ?
Ses04M_script01_1_F042 i don t understand you do i ?
Ses04M_script01_1_F043 yeah i can see that .
Ses04M_script01_1_M000 he saw it .
Ses04M_script01_1_M001 he was out here when it broke .
Ses04M_script01_1_M002 about four this morning . i heard it cracking and i woke up and looked out . he was standing right there when it cracked .
Ses04M_script01_1_M003 i don t know . after it cracked he ran back in the house and cried in the kitchen .
Ses04M_script01_1_M004 no . i i figured the best thing was to leave him alone .
Ses04M_script01_1_M005 i heard him right through the floor of my room .
Ses04M_script01_1_M006 i guess he is .
Ses04M_script01_1_M007 i don t know the meaning of it mom . but i know one thing we made a terrible mistake with dad .
Ses04M_script01_1_M008 being dishonest with him . that kind of thing always pays off and now it s paying off .
Ses04M_script01_1_M009 you know that larry s not coming back . and i know it . why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him ?
Ses04M_script01_1_M010 i don t want to argue with him but it s time he realized that nobody believes larry s alive anymore .
Ses04M_script01_1_M011 why shouldn t he dream of him ? walk the nights waiting for him .
Ses04M_script01_1_M012 do we contradict him ? do we say straight out that we have no hope anymore ? that we haven t had any hope for years now .
Ses04M_script01_1_M013 we ve gotta say it to him .
Ses04M_script01_1_M014 for god s sake three years . nobody comes back after three years . it s insane .
Ses04M_script01_1_M015 sit down mom . i want to talk to you .
Ses04M_script01_1_M016 alright alright alright . listen . you know why i asked annie here don t you ?
Ses04M_script01_1_M017 you know why .
Ses04M_script01_1_M018 going to ask her to marry me .
Ses04M_script01_1_M019 you know it s not only my business .
Ses04M_script01_1_M020 then it s alright . i ll go ahead with it ?
Ses04M_script01_1_M021 well then you know it s not only my business .
Ses04M_script01_1_M022 sometimes you infuriate me you know that ? isn t it your business too if i tell this to father and he throws a fit about it ? you have such a talent for ignoring things .
Ses04M_script01_1_M023 she s not larry s girl .
Ses04M_script01_1_M024 i don t know why it is but every time i reach out for something i want i have to pull back because other people will suffer . my whole bloody life time after time after time .
Ses04M_script01_1_M025 to hell with that .
Ses04M_script01_1_M026 i wanted to get this settled first .
Ses04M_script01_1_M027 well if she does then that s the end of it . from her letters i think she s forgotten him . we ll find out . then we ll thrash it out with dad . right mom ? don t avoid me .
Ses04M_script01_1_M028 so what ? i m not fast with women .
Ses04M_script01_1_M029 because it is .
Ses04M_script01_1_M030 line ?
Ses04M_script01_1_M031 alright then mom . did we skip something ? no . alright then mom .
Ses04M_script01_1_M032 yeah let s keep going .
Ses04M_script01_1_M033 i ve given it three years of thought . i d hope that if
Ses04M_script01_1_M034 father forgot about larry we d have a regular wedding and everything happy . if i can t get that here then i ll have to get out .
Ses04M_script01_1_M035 i ll get out . i ll get married and live someplace else . maybe new york .
Ses04M_script01_1_M036 i ve been a good son too long a good sucker . i m through with it .
Ses04M_script01_1_M037 the business ? the business doesn t inspire me .
Ses04M_script01_1_M038 yes . i like getting an hour a day . if i have to grub for money all day long at least at evening i want it beautiful .
Ses04M_script01_1_M039 i want a family . i want some kids . i want to build something i can give myself to . annie s in the middle of that . now where do i find it ?
Ses04M_script01_1_M040 yes on this i would .

Ses04M_script01_1_M042 i know that . just you help me stay here .
Ses04M_script01_1_M043 i am thinking that way .
Ses04M_script01_1_M044 no you don t . i m a pretty tough guy .
Ses04F_script03_2_F000 there was nothing in that you know that .
Ses04F_script03_2_F001 presents a trivial little broach .
Ses04F_script03_2_F002 not at all . it was very pretty . i still have it and i wear it often .
Ses04F_script03_2_F003 i did not . you made the whole thing up in your jealous imagination .
Ses04F_script03_2_F004 just a little perhaps nothing serious .
Ses04F_script03_2_F005 what of it ?
Ses04F_script03_2_F006 it gave him a lot of pleasure and it didn t hurt me .
Ses04F_script03_2_F007 if you hadn t been so nosey you never would have known a thing about it .
Ses04F_script03_2_F008 oh dear . i m bored with this conversation .
Ses04F_script03_2_F009 no thanks .
Ses04F_script03_2_F010 i don t see why you want it . you ve already had two glasses .
Ses04F_script03_2_F011 seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing .
Ses04F_script03_2_F012 it s become a habit with you .
Ses04F_script03_2_F013 oh don t be so stupid .
Ses04F_script03_2_F014 what ?
Ses04F_script03_2_F015 just making myself fascinating for you .
Ses04F_script03_2_F016 the woman s job is to allure the man . watch me a minute will you .
Ses04F_script03_2_F017 oh no it isn t
Ses04F_script03_2_F018 oh be quiet .
Ses04F_script03_2_F019 it doesn t seem to have worked such wonders with you .
Ses04F_script03_2_F020 adders don t snap they sting .
Ses04F_script03_2_F021 they sting .
Ses04F_script03_2_F022 i don t care okay . do you understand ? i don t care . i don t mind if they bark and roll about like hoops .
Ses04F_script03_2_F023 yes i did quite a lot .
Ses04F_script03_2_F024 mind your own business .
Ses04F_script03_2_F025 you re quite insufferable . i expect it s because you re drunk .
Ses04F_script03_2_F026 you always had a weak head .
Ses04F_script03_2_F027 on the contrary . a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy .
Ses04F_script03_2_F028 oh shut up .
Ses04F_script03_2_F029 not very funny dear . you d better have some more brandy .
Ses04F_script03_2_F030 why ?
Ses04F_script03_2_F031 there is no one upstairs . it s a photographer s studio .
Ses04F_script03_2_F032 they re away in tunis .
Ses04F_script03_2_F033 turn it on again please .
Ses04F_script03_2_F034 very well if you insist on being boorish and idiotic .
Ses04F_script03_2_F035 you re far too temperamental . try to control yourself .
Ses04F_script03_2_F036 go away go away . i hate you .
Ses04F_script03_2_F037 listen ? listen indeed . i m sick and tired of listening to you . you damn sadistic bully .
Ses04F_script03_2_F038 stop .
Ses04F_script03_2_F039 stop stop . i hate you . do you hear ? you re conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible .
Ses04F_script03_2_F040 this is the end do you understand ? the end 
Ses04F_script03_2_F041 finally and forever
Ses04F_script03_2_F042 oh i am . let go of me .
Ses04F_script03_2_F043 oh i hate you . it s a good thing that i found out in time what you re really like . marry you again ? never never never .
Ses04F_script03_2_F044 i d rather die in torment . beast . brute . calf swine .
Ses04F_script03_2_M000 as a matter of fact the real cause of that row was peter burden .
Ses04F_script03_2_M001 i knew nothing of the sort . you took presents from him .
Ses04F_script03_2_M002 i remember it well bristling with diamonds in the worst possible taste .
Ses04F_script03_2_M003 you went out of your way to torture me over peter burden .
Ses04F_script03_2_M004 you must admit that he was in love with you wasn t he ?
Ses04F_script03_2_M005 you let him kiss you . you said you did .
Ses04F_script03_2_M006 what of it ?
Ses04F_script03_2_M007 what about me ?
Ses04F_script03_2_M008 that s a nice point of view i must say .
Ses04F_script03_2_M009 so am i . bored stiff . want some brandy ?
Ses04F_script03_2_M010 i ll have some myself i think .
Ses04F_script03_2_M011 no particular reason . anyway they were very small ones .
Ses04F_script03_2_M012 you can hardly call three liquor glasses in the whole evening going on and on and on .
Ses04F_script03_2_M013 you needn t be so grand just because you don t happen to want any at the moment .
Ses04F_script03_2_M014 really amanda .
Ses04F_script03_2_M015 nothing .
Ses04F_script03_2_M016 going somewhere my dear ?
Ses04F_script03_2_M017 ah that reply has broken my heart .
Ses04F_script03_2_M018 as a matter of fact that s perfectly true .
Ses04F_script03_2_M019 yes it is .
Ses04F_script03_2_M020 it s a pity you don t have anymore brandy . it might have made you a little less disagreeable .
Ses04F_script03_2_M021 snap snap snap like a little adder .
Ses04F_script03_2_M022 non sense they have bags of venom behind their fangs and they snap .
Ses04F_script03_2_M023 they snap .
Ses04F_script03_2_M024 did you see much of peter burden after our divorce ?
Ses04F_script03_2_M025 i suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more then .
Ses04F_script03_2_M026 you must have had a riotous time . no restraint at all very enjoyable you never had much anyhow .
Ses04F_script03_2_M027 i m not in the least drunk .
Ses04F_script03_2_M028 i think i mentioned once before that i had three minute liquor glasses of brandy the whole evening long . a child of two couldn t get drunk on that .
Ses04F_script03_2_M029 very interesting and how about a child of six and a child of four and a child of nine .
Ses04F_script03_2_M030 they d get up a splendid little debate about that you know . intemperate tots .
Ses04F_script03_2_M031 very good idea . i will .
Ses04F_script03_2_M032 you d better turn that off i think .
Ses04F_script03_2_M033 it s very late and it will annoy the people upstairs .
Ses04F_script03_2_M034 there are people downstairs i suppose .
Ses04F_script03_2_M035 this is no time of year for tunis .
Ses04F_script03_2_M036 i ll do no such thing .
Ses04F_script03_2_M037 turn it off . it s driving me mad .
Ses04F_script03_2_M038 turn it off .
Ses04F_script03_2_M039 amanda listen .
Ses04F_script03_2_M040 very amusing .
Ses04F_script03_2_M041 you re a vile tempered loose living wicked little beast . and i hope i never see you again as long as i live .
Ses04F_script03_2_M042 you re not going like this .
Ses04F_script03_2_M043 you re not .
Ses04F_script03_2_M044 shut up . shut up . i wouldn t marry you again if you came crawling to me on your bended knees .
Ses04F_script03_2_M045 you re a mean evil minded little tempered witch . i hope to god i never set eyes on you again as long as i live . whore .
Ses04F_impro06_F000 thanks .
Ses04F_impro06_F001 you know it s just i just you know i mean it just happened . i just like i just keep expecting him to walk in you know .
Ses04F_impro06_F002 i just i just thought he would have longer you know because i m i mean when he found out he was sick we knew that wasn t good but i just i just thought that it would take longer you know ?
Ses04F_impro06_F003 yeah . i know . i know .
Ses04F_impro06_F004 yeah i know . but i d rather have him here with me you know . it s just not fair . i mean he he didn t get to do like anything . i mean he was

Ses04F_impro06_F006 it just doesn t seem fair .
Ses04F_impro06_F007 thank you for being here .
Ses04F_impro06_F008  laughter you re probably right . he probably would be pissed if we were all sitting around being upset about it . he d want us to have a party .
Ses04F_impro06_F009 and to drink in his honor . laughter 
Ses04F_impro06_F010 yeah i know .
Ses04F_impro06_M000 hey i m uh . i m really sorry about what happened . i don t um i mean what you can you do ? i mean it s 
Ses04F_impro06_M001 when i was seven my my grandmother died and i really i don t know i mean it was really hard to let go but the important thing is is that you do let go and your realize that you know they you know they this person had fun while they were while they were here and uh you know you work you work through it .
Ses04F_impro06_M002 mmhmm . yeah . yeah . i mean it s it s hard . it s hard .
Ses04F_impro06_M003 yeah .
Ses04F_impro06_M004 well i mean you know i mean it was i mean with that kind of condition 
Ses04F_impro06_M005 you know it s inevitable and i mean honestly it s it s almost like
Ses04F_impro06_M006 you know you don t you know how long do you want the person to go through that you know .
Ses04F_impro06_M007 it s sort of it s almost better off to rest in peace than he is to live in pain .
Ses04F_impro06_M008 yeah .
Ses04F_impro06_M009 it s not fair but i mean that s you know the course of life is that you know you meet people and you lose them .
Ses04F_impro06_M010 you re okay
Ses04F_impro06_M011 you know i think i think we should celebrate because i think that s what he would have wanted .
Ses04F_impro06_M012 yeah .
Ses04F_impro06_M013 that s right . that s right . i mean he would want us to you know celebrate the life that he that he lived and you know enjoy the rest of ours as much as we can .
Ses04F_impro06_M014 so 
Ses04F_script02_2_F000 about what ?
Ses04F_script02_2_F001 it s ridiculous .
Ses04F_script02_2_F002 it s pr . somebody sold you a bill of goods that this wonderful event is going to take place on the beach .
Ses04F_script02_2_F003 well sure everybody s told the same story . it keeps us all coming back for more . it keeps us all excited keeps us thinking that life is going to start any minute now if we can just find the right spot and get in on the action .
Ses04F_script02_2_F004 well i m sorry but it s still just fish to me .
Ses04F_script02_2_F005 goddamn it augie don t ask me that . you always ask me that . i hate it when you ask me that . it s insulting .
Ses04F_script02_2_F006 we just have different ideas about what this evening is supposed to look like .
Ses04F_script02_2_F007 for heaven s sake this is not about fish .
Ses04F_script02_2_F008 we totally skipped . right .
Ses04F_script02_2_F009 for heaven s sake grow up we are not going to see the grunions .
Ses04F_script02_2_F010 we never do . do we have we ever ?
Ses04F_script02_2_F011 twice is every time we ve tried that s ever .
Ses04F_script02_2_F012 no we won t . it s pointless . it s like waiting up to see santa clause .
Ses04F_script02_2_F013 god i feel as though my entire life is going to be spent standing on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly waiting for the fish to show up 
Ses04F_script02_2_F014 and the fish won t show up .
Ses04F_script02_2_F015 you don t understand anything i m saying .
Ses04F_script02_2_F016 i did want to see it . i always do . i keep thinking that this time will be the time but it never is .
Ses04F_script02_2_F017 for heaven s sake this is not about fish .
Ses04F_script02_2_F018 do you remember the first time we came to see it ? it was about four years ago right after we got married .
Ses04F_script02_2_F019 we thought i was pregnant and we had a bottle of champagne but no glasses . you asked me to dance . so we took off our shoes
Ses04F_script02_2_F020 and you popped the cork and while we were dancing you said the softest most intimate things to me
Ses04F_script02_2_F021 right into my ear so that i could hear them as much as so that i could feel them as much as hear them .
Ses04F_script02_2_F022 and i remember thinking this is it . at last at last i m as happy as i m supposed to be .
Ses04F_script02_2_F023 dancing barefoot in the sand drinking champagne from the bottle .
Ses04F_script02_2_F024 i would rather not remember some things . i would rather not hope for some things .
Ses04F_script02_2_F025 no .
Ses04F_script02_2_F026 no .
Ses04F_script02_2_F027 no . no .
Ses04F_script02_2_F028 no .
Ses04F_script02_2_F029 no .
Ses04F_script02_2_F030 no .
Ses04F_script02_2_F031 no .
Ses04F_script02_2_F032 i want something to turn out the way it s supposed to .
Ses04F_script02_2_F033 this what what is this ? this isn t even anything .
Ses04F_script02_2_F034 oh right sure this is standing on the beach . this is waiting . this is fighting .
Ses04F_script02_2_F035 but this isn t anything like i thought anything would be like .
Ses04F_script02_2_F036 this is just this . i mean it includes a lot in everything but it s just not you know something else . do you have any idea what i m trying to say ?
Ses04F_script02_2_F037 i know you are augie . really i do . i know you wanted this to be special and nice and it s the full moon and the sand and all but i just couldn t help thinking about being somewhere else .
Ses04F_script02_2_F038 i didn t say that .
Ses04F_script02_2_F039 for heaven s sake whatever i m doing i d rather be doing it with you .
Ses04F_script02_2_F040 well don t be ridiculous . don t you know that ? you re the one who probably wishes you were with somebody else
Ses04F_script02_2_F041 somebody who knew how to enjoy herself and didn t take everything so hard .
Ses04F_script02_2_F042 okay . fine . so we re in the wrong spot but we re with the right person .
Ses04F_script02_2_F043 yeah i noticed that . looks pretty on the water doesn t it big old white moon .
Ses04F_script02_2_F044 oh augie you brought refreshments .
Ses04F_script02_2_F045 well then i guess we don t need glasses .
Ses04F_script02_2_F046 i m beginning to think you might be right . i think this may be the spot after all . augie i m sorry .
Ses04F_script02_2_F047 or not .
Ses04F_script02_2_M000 well so what do you think ?
Ses04F_script02_2_M001 what i said .
Ses04F_script02_2_M002 it certainly is not . it s slightly exaggerated scientific fact .
Ses04F_script02_2_M003 i m not the only one . look at these people .
Ses04F_script02_2_M004 are we talking about the same thing ?
Ses04F_script02_2_M005 carla can i ask you something ? don t take this the wrong way but are you having your period ?
Ses04F_script02_2_M006 well then what s bugging you ?
Ses04F_script02_2_M007 there s nothing to it . we come down here . the grunions arrive . they do their little fish business . we go oh ah look at the fish . they go home . we go home .

Ses04F_script02_2_M013 i thought you wanted to see it .
Ses04F_script02_2_M014 no of course not .
Ses04F_script02_2_M015 it s just a fish . nothing to get traumatized over .
Ses04F_script02_2_M016 i ve been trying to work this backwards but i can t seem to pinpoint the moment when we took a turn for the worse . you were fine during the phone call from marge . dinner was okay . doing the dishes was no problem .
Ses04F_script02_2_M017 let s see i took a shower . you watched the news . you said the grunions are running tonight . i said great let s go . i feel lucky tonight .

Ses04F_script02_2_M030 well welcome to the human race . you think this is what i had in mind .
Ses04F_script02_2_M031 do you think that when i proposed i had this great fantasy going that four years down the line we d come to the beach and yell at each other over fish .
Ses04F_script02_2_M032 do you think that i knew that there d be times when you d look at me like i m a used kleenex and times i would look at you and think holy hell when s the next flight to alaska .
Ses04F_script02_2_M033 no no i m just like you . i thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and sand in our hair and wind in our
Ses04F_script02_2_M034 sand in our toes and wind in our hair and the fish will always come and the bills will always pay themselves and ha ha baby the jokes on us . because you know what you get 
Ses04F_script02_2_M035 you know what you get carla this .
Ses04F_script02_2_M036 yes it is .
Ses04F_script02_2_M037 right .
Ses04F_script02_2_M038 no i know me either .
Ses04F_script02_2_M039 i m doing the best i can .
Ses04F_script02_2_M040 maybe if you were with somebody else too .
Ses04F_script02_2_M041 no i know but still . i know i don t make you happy .
Ses04F_script02_2_M042 yeah ?
Ses04F_script02_2_M043 actually now that you mention it no i don t .
Ses04F_script02_2_M044 i don t know . it seemed like a good spot to me .
Ses04F_script02_2_M045 i mean look at the view you ve got of the moon from here .
Ses04F_script02_2_M046 well look at what we got here .
Ses04F_script02_2_M047 it s not champagne .
Ses04F_script02_2_M048 you still cold ? do you want to go home ?
Ses04F_script02_2_M049 shh . if we re very quiet the fish might come .
Ses04F_script02_2_M050 or not .
Ses04M_script03_1_F000 do you think it s them ?
Ses04M_script03_1_F001 nobody knows we re here except freda and she wouldn t ring up .
Ses04M_script03_1_F002 what are we to do ?
Ses04M_script03_1_F003 now and always sweet .
Ses04M_script03_1_F004 it was bound to come sooner or later .
Ses04M_script03_1_F005 oh it sent shivers up my spine .
Ses04M_script03_1_F006 behave exquisitely .
Ses04M_script03_1_F007 certainly . i shall probably do a court curtsey .
Ses04M_script03_1_F008 but what s so horrible is that one can t stay happy .
Ses04M_script03_1_F009 it s true . the whole business is a very poor joke .
Ses04M_script03_1_F010 yes meaning just that .
Ses04M_script03_1_F011 don t laugh at me . i m serious .
Ses04M_script03_1_F012 who s they ?
Ses04M_script03_1_F013 if i laugh at everything i must laugh at us too .
Ses04M_script03_1_F014 how long will it last this ludicrous and overbearing love of ours ?
Ses04M_script03_1_F015 shall we always want to bicker and fight ?
Ses04M_script03_1_F016 oh dear . should we like that .
Ses04M_script03_1_F017 what happens if one of us dies ? does the one that s left still laugh ?
Ses04M_script03_1_F018 well that s serious enough isn t it ?
Ses04M_script03_1_F019 darling i believe you re talking nonsense .
Ses04M_script03_1_F020 elliot worms don t pop .
Ses04M_script03_1_F021 thank you dear . the same applies to you except that if i catch you so much as looking at another woman i will kill you .
Ses04M_script03_1_F022 which particular one ?
Ses04M_script03_1_F023 oh charles that was his name charles . oh he did wriggle so beautifully .
Ses04M_script03_1_F024 i know you did . you threw it out of the window into the grand canal . i don t think i ll ever forgive you for that .
Ses04M_script03_1_F025 it went on intermittently for days .
Ses04M_script03_1_F026 it burnt my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom .
Ses04M_script03_1_F027 that was the first time you ever hit me .
Ses04M_script03_1_F028 the manager came in and found is rolling about on the floor biting and scratching like panthers . oh dear .
Ses04M_script03_1_F029 how ridiculous . how utterly utterly ridiculous .
Ses04M_script03_1_F030 and very much sillier .
Ses04M_script03_1_M000 good god .
Ses04M_script03_1_M001 i wonder .
Ses04M_script03_1_M002 it must be them then .
Ses04M_script03_1_M003 we ll be alright darling . whatever happens aren t we ?
Ses04M_script03_1_M004 i don t care then .
Ses04M_script03_1_M005 hello hello . what ? wrong number .
Ses04M_script03_1_M006 what shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us ?
Ses04M_script03_1_M007 with the mo with the most perfect poise ?
Ses04M_script03_1_M008 ah . things that ought to matter dreadfully don t matter when one s happy do they ?
Ses04M_script03_1_M009 don t say that darling .
Ses04M_script03_1_M010 meaning that sacred and beautiful thing love ?
Ses04M_script03_1_M011 what does it all mean ? that s what i ask myself in my ceaseless quest for ultimate truth . dear god what does it all mean ?
Ses04M_script03_1_M012 you mustn t be serious my dear . that s just what they want .
Ses04M_script03_1_M013 all the futile moralists who try to make life unbearable . laugh at them . be flippant . laugh at everything . all their sacred shibboleths . flippancy brings out the acid acid in their damn sweetness and light .
Ses04M_script03_1_M014 certainly you must . we re figures of fun alright .
Ses04M_script03_1_M015 who knows .
Ses04M_script03_1_M016 no . that fire will fade along with our passion .
Ses04M_script03_1_M017 it all depends on how well we ve played .
Ses04M_script03_1_M018 yes . yes with all his might .
Ses04M_script03_1_M019 no no it isn t . death s very laughable such a cunning little mystery all done with mirrors .
Ses04M_script03_1_M020 so is everyone else in the long run . let s be superficial and pity the poor philosophers . let s blow trumpets and squeakers and and enjoy the party as much as we can like very small quite idiotic little school children .
Ses04M_script03_1_M021 let s savor the delight of the moment . come and kiss me darling before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets .
Ses04M_script03_1_M022 i don t mind what you do see ? you can paint yourself bright green all over and dance naked in the place vendome and rush off madly with all the men in the world and i shan t say a word as long as you love me best .
Ses04M_script03_1_M023 do you remember that awful scene we had in venice ?
Ses04M_script03_1_M024 the one when you bought that little painted wooded snake and put it on my bed ?
Ses04M_script03_1_M025 horrible thing . i hated it .
Ses04M_script03_1_M026 how long did that row last ?
Ses04M_script03_1_M027 the worst one was in cannes when your curling irons burnt holes in my dressing gown .
Ses04M_script03_1_M028 line ?
Ses04M_script03_1_M029 how that was a rouser wasn t it ?
Ses04M_script03_1_M030 i didn t hit you very hard .
Ses04M_script03_1_M031 ah i shall never forget his face .
Ses04M_script03_1_M032 yes . we were very much younger then .
Ses04M_script03_1_M033 as a matter of fact the real cause of that row was peter burden .
Ses04M_script01_3_F000 you re the only one i know who loves his parents .
Ses04M_script01_3_F001 it s okay . it s a good thing . you know it s lovely here and the air is sweet .
Ses04M_script01_3_F002 no not sorry but i m not going to stay .
Ses04M_script01_3_F003 in the first place your mother as much as told me to go .
Ses04M_script01_3_F004 you saw that and then you ve been kind of 
Ses04M_script01_3_F005 well kind of embarrassed ever since i got here .
Ses04M_script01_3_F006 i knew they would your mother anyway .
Ses04M_script01_3_F007 from her point of view why else would i come ?
Ses04M_script01_3_F008 i guess this is why i came .
Ses04M_script01_3_F009 chris i ve been ready a long long time .
Ses04M_script01_3_F010 i almost got married two years ago .
Ses04M_script01_3_F011 you started to write me .
Ses04M_script01_3_F012 every day since .
Ses04M_script01_3_F013 i was waiting for you chris . til then you never wrote and when you did what did you say ? you sure can be ambiguous you know .
Ses04M_script01_3_F014 i ll never forgive you . why did you wait all these years ? all i ve done is sit around and wonder if i was crazy for thinking of you .
Ses04M_script01_3_F015 not like that you re not .
Ses04M_script01_3_F016 like larry s brother . do it like you chris . what is it chris ?
Ses04M_script01_3_F017 no what is it chris ? your mother ?
Ses04M_script01_3_F018 then what s wrong . even in your letters there was something ashamed .
Ses04M_script01_3_F019 you ve got to tell me .
Ses04M_script01_3_F020 it wouldn t work this way .
Ses04M_script01_3_F021 yeah sure .
Ses04M_script01_3_F022 how many ?
Ses04M_script01_3_F023 oh gees .
Ses04M_script01_3_F024 and do you still feel that way ?
Ses04M_script01_3_F025 because you mustn t feel that way anymore chris . because you have a right to everything you have everything chris to me too .
Ses04M_script01_3_F026 and your money there s nothing wrong in your money . your father put hundreds of planes in the air . you should be proud . a man should be paid for that .
Ses04M_script01_3_F027 what ll i do with a fortune ?
Ses04M_script01_3_M000 i know . it went out of style didn t it ?
Ses04M_script01_3_M001 so you re not sorry you came ?
Ses04M_script01_3_M002 why ?
Ses04M_script01_3_M003 what ?
Ses04M_script01_3_M004 the trouble is i planned on sneaking up on you over a period of a week or so . but they take it for granted that we re all set .
Ses04M_script01_3_M005 how did you know ?
Ses04M_script01_3_M006 well wouldn t you want to ?
Ses04M_script01_3_M007 i guess you know this is why i asked you to come .
Ses04M_script01_3_M008 ann i love you . i love you a great deal . i love you .
Ses04M_script01_3_M009 i have no imagination . that s all i know to tell you . i m embarrassing you .
Ses04M_script01_3_M010 i didn t want to tell it to you here . i wanted someplace we d never been someplace where we d be brand new to each other .
Ses04M_script01_3_M011 you think this is wrong don t you this yard this chair ? i want you to be ready for me . i don t want to win you away from anything .
Ses04M_script01_3_M012 then he s gone forever ? you re sure ?
Ses04M_script01_3_M013 why didn t you ?
Ses04M_script01_3_M014 you felt something that far back ?
Ses04M_script01_3_M015 anne why didn t you let me know ?
Ses04M_script01_3_M016 anne give me a kiss . give me a 
Ses04M_script01_3_M017 i kissed you . i kissed annie . how long how long i ve waited to kiss you .
Ses04M_script01_3_M018 anne we re going to live now . i m going to make you so happy .
Ses04M_script01_3_M019 i kissed you .
Ses04M_script01_3_M020 let s drive somewhere . i want to be alone with you .
Ses04M_script01_3_M021 no no nothing like that .
Ses04M_script01_3_M022 yes i suppose there has been . but it s going from me .
Ses04M_script01_3_M023 i don t know where to start .
Ses04M_script01_3_M024 it s all mixed up with so many other things . you remember overseas i was in command of a company ?
Ses04M_script01_3_M025 well i lost them .
Ses04M_script01_3_M026 just about all .
Ses04M_script01_3_M027 it takes a little time to toss that off because they weren t just men .
Ses04M_script01_3_M028 for instance one time it d been raining several days . and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks put them in my pocket . that s only a little thing but that s the kind of guys i had .
Ses04M_script01_3_M029 they didn t die . they killed themselves for each other . i mean that exactly . a little more selfish and they d have been here today .
Ses04M_script01_3_M030 and i got this idea watching them go down everything was being destroyed see ? but to me it seemed there was one new thing that was made 
Ses04M_script01_3_M031 a kind of responsibility . man for man . you understand me ? and then i went home and it was incredible .
Ses04M_script01_3_M032 there was no meaning in it here . the whole thing to them was some sort of bus accident . then i went to work for dad and that whole rat race again . i felt what you said ashamed somehow
Ses04M_script01_3_M033 because nobody was changed . it seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys . i felt wrong to be alive 
Ses04M_script01_3_M034 to open that bank book to drive the new car to see the new refrigerator . i mean you can take these things out of a war but when you drive the new car you have to know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man .
Ses04M_script01_3_M035 you have to be a little better because of that . otherwise we have is really loot and there s blood on it . i don t want to take any of it . i guess that included you .
Ses04M_script01_3_M036 i want you now annie .
Ses04M_script01_3_M037 annie annie i m going to make you a fortune .
Ses04F_script01_1_F000 what s he going to say ? maybe we should tell him before he sees it .
Ses04F_script01_1_F001 how could he see it ? i was the first one up . he was still in bed .
Ses04F_script01_1_F002 when ?
Ses04F_script01_1_F003 what was he doing out here at four in the morning ?
Ses04F_script01_1_F004 did you talk to him ?
Ses04F_script01_1_F005 he cried hard ?
Ses04F_script01_1_F006 what was he doing out here at that hour ? he s dreaming about him again . he s walking around at night .
Ses04F_script01_1_F007 he s getting just like after he died .
Ses04F_script01_1_F008 what s the meaning in that ?
Ses04F_script01_1_F009 what ?
Ses04F_script01_1_F010 what do you mean dishonest ?
Ses04F_script01_1_F011 what do you want to do argue with him ?
Ses04F_script01_1_F012 you can t say that to him .
Ses04F_script01_1_F013 how are you going to prove it ? can you prove it ?
Ses04F_script01_1_F014 to you it is and to me but not to him . you can talk yourself blue in the face but there s no body and no grave so where are you ?
Ses04F_script01_1_F015 the trouble is the goddamn newspapers . every month some boy turns up from nowhere so the next one is going to be larry .
Ses04F_script01_1_F016 why ?
Ses04F_script01_1_F017 well i got an idea but what s the story ?
Ses04F_script01_1_F018 well that s only your business chris .
Ses04F_script01_1_F019 what do you want me to do ? you re old enough to know your own mind .
Ses04F_script01_1_F020 well you want to make sure that father isn t going to 
Ses04F_script01_1_F021 i m just saying .
Ses04F_script01_1_F022 i ignore what i got to ignore . the girl is larry s girl .
Ses04F_script01_1_F023 from father s point of view he s not dead and you have no right to take his girl .
Ses04F_script01_1_F024 now you can go on from there and you know where to go but i m telling you i don t know where to go . see i don t know . now what can i do for you ?
Ses04F_script01_1_F025 you re a considerate fellow . there s nothing wrong in that .
Ses04F_script01_1_F026 did you ask annie yet ?
Ses04F_script01_1_F027 how do you know she ll marry you ? maybe she feels the same way father does .
Ses04F_script01_1_F028 the trouble is you don t see enough women . you never did .
Ses04F_script01_1_F029 i don t see why it has to be annie .
Ses04F_script01_1_F030 well that s a good answer but it don t answer anything . you haven t seen her since you went to war . it s been five years .
Ses04F_script01_1_F031 i don t want a diagram . he thinks he s coming back chris .
Ses04F_script01_1_F032 you marry that girl . you re pronouncing him dead . now what happens to your father ? do you know because i don t ?
Ses04F_script01_1_F033 just give it some more thought .
Ses04F_script01_1_F034 what the hell is this ?
Ses04F_script01_1_F035 are you crazy ?
Ses04F_script01_1_F036 you ve got a business here . what the hell is this ?
Ses04F_script01_1_F037 must you be inspired ?
Ses04F_script01_1_F038 you mean tell me something you mean you d really leave the business ?
Ses04F_script01_1_F039 well you don t want to think that way .
Ses04F_script01_1_F040 alright but don t think that way
Ses04F_script01_1_F041 because what the hell did we work for ? this whole shooting match is just for you chris .
Ses04F_script01_1_F042 but don t think that way . you hear me ?
Ses04F_script01_1_F043 i don t understand you do i ?
Ses04F_script01_1_F044 yeah . i can see that .
Ses04F_script01_1_M000 he saw it .
Ses04F_script01_1_M001 he was out here when it broke .
Ses04F_script01_1_M002 about four this morning . i heard it cracking and i woke up and looked out . he was standing right there when it cracked .
Ses04F_script01_1_M003 i don t know . when it cracked he ran back into the house and cried in the kitchen .
Ses04F_script01_1_M004 no i figured the best thing was to leave him alone .
Ses04F_script01_1_M005 i could hear him right through the floor of my room .
Ses04F_script01_1_M006 i guess he is .
Ses04F_script01_1_M007 i don t know the meaning of this mom . but i know one thing you made a terrible mistake with dad .
Ses04F_script01_1_M008 being dishonest with him that kind of thing always pays off and now it s paying off .
Ses04F_script01_1_M009 you know that larry s not coming back and i know it . why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him ?
Ses04F_script01_1_M010 i don t want to argue with him but it s time that he realizes that larry s not coming back anymore .
Ses04F_script01_1_M011 why shouldn t he dream of him ? walk the nights waiting for him ? do we contradict him ? do we say straight out that we have no hope anymore that we haven t had any hope for years now ?
Ses04F_script01_1_M012 we ve got to say it to him .
Ses04F_script01_1_M013 for god s sake three years . nobody comes back after three years . it s insane .
Ses04F_script01_1_M014 sit down mom . i want to talk to you .
Ses04F_script01_1_M015 alright alright alright . listen . you know why i asked annie here don t you ?
Ses04F_script01_1_M016 you know why .
Ses04F_script01_1_M017 i m going to ask her to marry me .
Ses04F_script01_1_M018 you know it s not only my business .
Ses04F_script01_1_M019 then it s alright . i ll go ahead with it .
Ses04F_script01_1_M020 then it isn t just my business .
Ses04F_script01_1_M021 sometimes you infuriate me . you know that ? isn t it your business too if i tell this to father and he throws a fit about it .
Ses04F_script01_1_M022 sometimes you have a sometimes you have a talent for ignoring things .
Ses04F_script01_1_M023 she s not larry s girl .
Ses04F_script01_1_M024 i don t know why it is but every time i reach out for something i want i have to pull back because other people will suffer . my whole bloody life time after time after time .
Ses04F_script01_1_M025 to hell with that .
Ses04F_script01_1_M026 i wanted to get this settled first .
Ses04F_script01_1_M027 well if she does then that s the end of it . from her letters i think she s forgotten him . i ll find out .
Ses04F_script01_1_M028 and then we ll thrash it out with dad right mom . don t avoid me .
Ses04F_script01_1_M029 so what i m not fast with women .
Ses04F_script01_1_M030 because it is .
Ses04F_script01_1_M031 i can t help it . i know her best . i was brought up next door to her .
Ses04F_script01_1_M032 these years when i think of someone for my wife i think of annie . what do you want a diagram ?
Ses04F_script01_1_M033 alright then mom .
Ses04F_script01_1_M034 i ve given it three years of thought . i hoped that if i waited dad would forget about larry
Ses04F_script01_1_M035 and everything would be happy and we would have a regular wedding . but if that can t happen here then i ll have to get out .
Ses04F_script01_1_M036 i ll get out . i ll get married and live someplace else maybe new york .
Ses04F_script01_1_M037 i ve been a good son too long . a good sucker i m through with it .
Ses04F_script01_1_M038 the business the business doesn t inspire me .
Ses04F_script01_1_M039 yes i like it an hour a day . if i have to grub for money all day long at least at evening i want it beautiful .
Ses04F_script01_1_M040 i want i want a family . i want some kids . i want to build something i give myself to . annie is in the middle of that . now where do i find it ?
Ses04F_script01_1_M041 yes on this i would .

Ses04F_script01_1_M045 no . i m a pretty tough guy .
Ses04F_script01_2_F000 why did he invite her ?
Ses04F_script01_2_F001 it s been three years . why all of a sudden ?
Ses04F_script01_2_F002 nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see .
Ses04F_script01_2_F003 she s not going to marry him .
Ses04F_script01_2_F004 it s got that about it .
Ses04F_script01_2_F005 what s going on here joe ?
Ses04F_script01_2_F006 no line .
Ses04F_script01_2_F007 she s not his girl joe . she knows she s not .
Ses04F_script01_2_F008 then why is she still single ? new york is full of men . why hasn t she married ?
Ses04F_script01_2_F009 probably a hundred people told her she s foolish but she s waited .
Ses04F_script01_2_F010 because she knows what i know that s why . she s faithful as a rock .
Ses04F_script01_2_F011 in my worst moments i think of her waiting and i know again that i m right .
Ses04F_script01_2_F012 nobody in this house dares take her faith away joe . strangers might but not his father not his brother .
Ses04F_script01_2_F013 i want you to act like he s coming back both of you . don t think i haven t noticed you since he invited her . i won t stand for any nonsense .
Ses04F_script01_2_F014 because if he s not coming back i ll kill myself .
Ses04F_script01_2_F015 laugh laugh at me but why did that happen the very night she came back ?
Ses04F_script01_2_F016 she goes to sleep in his room and his memorial breaks in pieces . look look at it . joe

Ses04F_script01_2_M001 well maybe maybe he just wanted to see her again .
Ses04F_script01_2_M002 what do you mean ? he was brought up next door to the girl his whole life . why shouldn t he want to see her again ?
Ses04F_script01_2_M003 don t look at me like that . he didn t tell me anymore than he told you .

Ses04M_script03_2_F001 the manager came in and found us rolling about on the floor biting and scratching like panthers . oh dear .
Ses04M_script03_2_F002 how ridiculous . how utterly utterly ridiculous .
Ses04M_script03_2_F003 and very much sillier .
Ses04M_script03_2_F004 you knew there was nothing in that .
Ses04M_script03_2_F005 presents ? a trivial little brooch .
Ses04M_script03_2_F006 not at all . it was very pretty . i still have it and i wear it often .
Ses04M_script03_2_F007 i did not . you made the whole thing up in your jealous imagination .
Ses04M_script03_2_F008 just a little perhaps nothing serious .
Ses04M_script03_2_F009 let him kiss you .
Ses04M_script03_2_F010 what of it ?
Ses04M_script03_2_F011 it gave him a lot of pleasure and it didn t hurt me .
Ses04M_script03_2_F012 if you hadn t been so nosey you never would have known a thing about it .
Ses04M_script03_2_F013 oh dear . i m bored with this conversation .
Ses04M_script03_2_F014 no thanks .
Ses04M_script03_2_F015 i don t see why you want it . you ve already had two glasses .
Ses04M_script03_2_F016 it seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing .
Ses04M_script03_2_F017 it s become a habit with you .
Ses04M_script03_2_F018 oh don t be so stupid .
Ses04M_script03_2_F019 what ?
Ses04M_script03_2_F020 no just making myself fascinating for you
Ses04M_script03_2_F021 the woman s job is to allure the man . watch me a minute will you ?
Ses04M_script03_2_F022 oh no it isn t .
Ses04M_script03_2_F023 oh be quiet .
Ses04M_script03_2_F024 it s a pity you didn t it s a pity you didn t have more brandy .
Ses04M_script03_2_F025 it doesn t seem to have worked such wonders with you .
Ses04M_script03_2_F026 adders don t snap they sting .
Ses04M_script03_2_F027 they sting .
Ses04M_script03_2_F028 i don t care . do you understand ? i don t care . i don t mind if they bark and roll about like hoops .

Ses04M_script03_2_F030 mind your own business .
Ses04M_script03_2_F031 you re quite insufferable . i expected it s because you re drunk .
Ses04M_script03_2_F032 you always had a weak head .
Ses04M_script03_2_F033 on the contrary a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy .
Ses04M_script03_2_F034 oh shut up .
Ses04M_script03_2_F035 not very funny dear . you d better have some more brandy .
Ses04M_script03_2_F036 why ?
Ses04M_script03_2_F037 there aren t any people upstairs . it s a photographer s studio .
Ses04M_script03_2_F038 they re away in tunis .
Ses04M_script03_2_F039 turn it on again please .
Ses04M_script03_2_F040 very well if you insist on being boorish and idiotic .
Ses04M_script03_2_F041 go away . go away . i hate you .
Ses04M_script03_2_F042 you are far too temperamental . try to control yourself .
Ses04M_script03_2_F043 we swapped . listen .
Ses04M_script03_2_F044 listen indeed . i am sick and tired of listening to you you damn sadistic bully .
Ses04M_script03_2_F045 stop .
Ses04M_script03_2_F046 stop . i hate you . do you hear me ? you re conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible .
Ses04M_script03_2_F047 this is the end . do you understand the end ? finally and forever .
Ses04M_script03_2_F048 oh yes i am .
Ses04M_script03_2_F049 let go of me . you re a cruel fiend and i hate and loath you . thank god i discovered in time what you re really like .

Ses04M_script03_2_F051 never never never . i d rather die in torment . beast brute .
Ses04M_script03_2_F052 swine .
Ses04M_script03_2_M000 that was a rouser wasn t it ?
Ses04M_script03_2_M001 i didn t hit you very hard .
Ses04M_script03_2_M002 i shall never forget his face .
Ses04M_script03_2_M003 we were very much younger then .
Ses04M_script03_2_M004 as a matter of fact the real cause of that row was peter burden .
Ses04M_script03_2_M005 i knew nothing of the sort . you took presents from him .
Ses04M_script03_2_M006 i remember it well bristling with diamonds in the worst possible taste .
Ses04M_script03_2_M007 you went out of your way to torture me over peter burden .
Ses04M_script03_2_M008 you must admit that he was in love with you wasn t he ?
Ses04M_script03_2_M009 line ?
Ses04M_script03_2_M010 you let him kiss you . you said you did .
Ses04M_script03_2_M011 what of it ?
Ses04M_script03_2_M012 what about me ?
Ses04M_script03_2_M013 that s a nice point of view i must say .
Ses04M_script03_2_M014 so am i bored stiff .
Ses04M_script03_2_M015 you want some brandy ?
Ses04M_script03_2_M016 i ll have a little myself i think .
Ses04M_script03_2_M017 no particular reason . anyhow they were very small ones .
Ses04M_script03_2_M018 you can hardly call three liquor glasses in a whole evening going on and on and on .
Ses04M_script03_2_M019 you needn t be so grand just because you don t happen to want any at the moment .
Ses04M_script03_2_M020 really amanda
Ses04M_script03_2_M021 nothing .
Ses04M_script03_2_M022 going out somewhere my dear ?
Ses04M_script03_2_M023 oh . that reply has broken my heart .
Ses04M_script03_2_M024 as a matter of fact that s perfectly true .
Ses04M_script03_2_M025 yes it is .
Ses04M_script03_2_M026 line ?
Ses04M_script03_2_M027 it s a pity you didn t have any more brandy . it might have made you a little less disagreeable .
Ses04M_script03_2_M028 line ?
Ses04M_script03_2_M029 snap . oh snap snap snap like a little adder .
Ses04M_script03_2_M030 they nonsense they have a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap .
Ses04M_script03_2_M031 they snap .
Ses04M_script03_2_M032 did you see much of peter burden after our divorce ?
Ses04M_script03_2_M033 i suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more then hmm ?
Ses04M_script03_2_M034 you must have had a riotous time .
Ses04M_script03_2_M035 no restraint at all very enjoyable . you never had much anyhow .
Ses04M_script03_2_M036 i m not in the least drunk .
Ses04M_script03_2_M037 i think i mentioned once before that i ve only had three minute liquor glasses of brandy this whole evening . that s hardly enough to get a child of two drunk .
Ses04M_script03_2_M038 very interesting . and how about a child of four and a child of six and a child of nine ?
Ses04M_script03_2_M039 we might get up a splendid little a splendid little debate about this you know intemperate tots .
Ses04M_script03_2_M040 very good idea . i will
Ses04M_script03_2_M041 you better turn that off i think .
Ses04M_script03_2_M042 it s late and the people upstairs will get annoyed .
Ses04M_script03_2_M043 there are people downstairs i suppose
Ses04M_script03_2_M044 this is no time of year for tunis .
Ses04M_script03_2_M045 i will do no such thing .
Ses04M_script03_2_M046 turn it off . it s driving me mad .
Ses04M_script03_2_M047 turn it off .
Ses04M_script03_2_M048 listen

Ses04M_script02_1_F008 there is no point in coming down here .
Ses04M_script02_1_F009 that s my point .
Ses04M_script02_1_F010 so let s go home .
Ses04M_script02_1_F011 not particularly .
Ses04M_script02_1_F012 i just don t . it s stupid .
Ses04M_script02_1_F013 pass up what ? these little fish swim onto the beach flop around and then they swim away . and then they die .
Ses04M_script02_1_F014 what are you so excited about ?
Ses04M_script02_1_F015 this isn t a moon landing we re talking about . it s fish . it s fish nobody even eats .
Ses04M_script02_1_F016 i m just not .
Ses04M_script02_1_F017 yes .
Ses04M_script02_1_F018 last year you will also remember our shoes got wet . i got sand in my panties . we got into a big fight over nothing . you got a sore throat and we did not see the grunions .
Ses04M_script02_1_F019 we didn t see them the first time either .
Ses04M_script02_1_F020 that s the wind .
Ses04M_script02_1_F021 about what ?
Ses04M_script02_1_M000 what time is it ? they re supposed to run around midnight . this is great isn t it ? look at this night we ve got here couldn t be better .
Ses04M_script02_1_M001 actually i wanted to go a little farther up the coast get away from the lights and the people but i was afraid we d miss it . how you doing ?
Ses04M_script02_1_M002 is that is that is that just foam ? i can t even tell . although if you can t tell it s probably isn t them . it ll probably be unmistakable don t you think ?
Ses04M_script02_1_M003 how you doing ? oh no you know what i did ? i forgot to bring my flashlight . how could i be so stupid ? i should have brought my flashlight .
Ses04M_script02_1_M004 the flashlight the silver one . there s only one isn t there ?
Ses04M_script02_1_M005 whose is it ?
Ses04M_script02_1_M006 well sure .
Ses04M_script02_1_M007 no of course our flashlight yours and mine . me flashlight es su flashlight naturally . how could we not think to bring it ? i hope the moon stays out .
Ses04M_script02_1_M008 i wonder do they always run during a full moon ? i can t remember if it was full last year . remember ?
Ses04M_script02_1_M009 are you cold ? do you want my jacket ? we should have brought the blanket our blanket .
Ses04M_script02_1_M010 oh man . this is great . i didn t even think to bring a six pack . six pack would be just the ticket right about now . i can t believe i forgot . i m like a kid . it s amazing i got out of the house with my fly zipped . oh .
Ses04M_script02_1_M011 i wonder if they can hear me talk or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around .
Ses04M_script02_1_M012 you want my jacket ?
Ses04M_script02_1_M013 are you kidding ? we d miss it . we just got here . what s the point of coming down here if we just turn around and go home ?
Ses04M_script02_1_M014 right .
Ses04M_script02_1_M015 that s my point too .
Ses04M_script02_1_M016 no no no . that s not my point . my point is is that there s no point in coming down here if we just leave . don t you want to see it ?
Ses04M_script02_1_M017 why not ?
Ses04M_script02_1_M018 honey this is a natural phenomenon . i mean this only happens once a year . it s a great opportunity . think about the people in kansas . they d have to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to come see this . we re just forty minutes away . it s too good to pass up .
Ses04M_script02_1_M019 yeah but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives . i mean all that flopping around is laying eggs or what do you spawning or mating something like that .
Ses04M_script02_1_M020 there s mystery here and magic .
Ses04M_script02_1_M021 oh it s a big night for these guys . uh life s last orgy .
Ses04M_script02_1_M022 yeah they do . okay . but it s fish who do something none of the other fish do like the swallows are returning to capistrano or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs like that .
Ses04M_script02_1_M023 there s mystery here and magic a little bit of the unexplainable . i don t see how you can not be interested .
Ses04M_script02_1_M024 for real ?
Ses04M_script02_1_M025 i don t get it . first time we came here to see it you said it was the best night of your life . and last year i remember distinctly you were so excited to get here you stubbed your toe rushing me out the door and didn t even notice until we were in the car .
Ses04M_script02_1_M026 we weren t in a good spot .
Ses04M_script02_1_M027 we just weren t in a good spot . this is a much better spot . i ve got good instincts for these things . look there . what s that ? is that 
Ses04M_script02_1_M028 no it s just seaweed isn t it ? oh man this is great . i wouldn t miss this for anything . i mean think about this . i know you re not interested but just think about this for a minute .
Ses04M_script02_1_M029 out there someplace is this huge mass of silver fish heading this way . they don t know why . we don t know why . it wasn t a decision . they didn t take a vote . no one sent them an invitation or a map 
Ses04M_script02_1_M030 just some little instinctual time release firecracker went off in their little bodies and all as one they turned and formed a line as long as the california coast and started swimming .
Ses04M_script02_1_M031 they re swimming right now as if that s the only thing that matters . it s single mindedness with no mind . urgency that s pure urge .
Ses04M_script02_1_M032 they don t know what drives them . they don t give it a name or ask a question . they just turn as one and start the swim that brings them here to this place where we stand for a massive celebration of sex and death . oh man i m giving myself goose bumps . all my hairs are popping up .
Ses04M_script02_1_M033 well so what did you think ?
Ses04M_script02_2_F000 look at this goose bumps .
Ses04M_script02_2_F001 about what ?
Ses04M_script02_2_F002 it s ridiculous .
Ses04M_script02_2_F003 it s pr . somebody sold you a bill of goods that this wonderful event is going to take place on the beach .
Ses04M_script02_2_F004 sure . they re all told the same story . it s what keeps us coming back for more keeps us excited keeps us thinking that life is going to start any minute now if we could just find the right spot get in on the action .
Ses04M_script02_2_F005 well i m sorry but it s still just fish to me .
Ses04M_script02_2_F006 goddamn it augie don t ask me that . i hate it when you ask me that . you always ask me that . it s insulting .
Ses04M_script02_2_F007 we just have different ideas about what this evening is supposed to look like .
Ses04M_script02_2_F008 for heaven s sake we are not going to see the grunions .
Ses04M_script02_2_F009 we never do do we ? have we ever ?
Ses04M_script02_2_F010 twice is every time we ve tried . that s ever .
Ses04M_script02_2_F011 no we won t . it s pointless . it s like waiting up to see santa claus . i feel as though my entire life is going to be spent standing on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly waiting for the fish to show up . and the fish won t show up .
Ses04M_script02_2_F012 you don t have any idea what i m saying .
Ses04M_script02_2_F013 i did want to see it . i always do . i keep thinking this time will be the time but it never is .
Ses04M_script02_2_F014 for heaven s sake this is not about fish .
Ses04M_script02_2_F015 do you remember the first time we came to see it ?
Ses04M_script02_2_F016 it was about four years ago right after we got married . we thought i was pregnant and we had a bottle of champagne but no glasses . you asked me to dance . so we took off our shoes and you popped the cork .
Ses04M_script02_2_F017 and while we were dancing you said the softest most intimate things to me right into my ear so that i could feel them as much as hear them . and i remember thinking this is it . at last at last i m as happy as i m supposed to be .
Ses04M_script02_2_F018 dancing barefoot in the sand drinking champagne from the bottle .
Ses04M_script02_2_F019 i d rather not remember some things . i d rather not hope for some things .
Ses04M_script02_2_F020 no .
Ses04M_script02_2_F021 no .
Ses04M_script02_2_F022 no .
Ses04M_script02_2_F023 no .
Ses04M_script02_2_F024 no .
Ses04M_script02_2_F025 no .
Ses04M_script02_2_F026 i want something to turn out the way it s supposed to .
Ses04M_script02_2_F027 this what ? what is this ? this isn t even anything .
Ses04M_script02_2_F028 oh right sure . this is standing on the beach . this is waiting . this is fighting .
Ses04M_script02_2_F029 but this isn t anything like i thought anything would be like .
Ses04M_script02_2_F030 this is just this . i mean it includes a lot and everything but it s just not you know something else . do you have any idea what i m trying to say ?
Ses04M_script02_2_F031 i know you are augie . really i do . i know you meant for this to be special and nice and it s the full moon and the sand and everything . but i just couldn t help thinking about being somewhere else .
Ses04M_script02_2_F032 i didn t say that .
Ses04M_script02_2_F033 for heaven s sake whatever i m doing i d rather be doing it with you .
Ses04M_script02_2_F034 well don t be ridiculous . don t you know that ? you re the one who probably wishes you were with somebody else somebody who knew how to enjoy herself and didn t take everything so hard .
Ses04M_script02_2_F035 okay fine . so we re in the wrong spot but we re with the right person .
Ses04M_script02_2_F036 yeah i noticed that . looks pretty on the water doesn t it ? big ol white moon . i m sorry augie .
Ses04M_script02_2_F037 or not .
Ses04M_script02_2_M000 well so what d you think ?
Ses04M_script02_2_M001 what i said .
Ses04M_script02_2_M002 certainly is not . it s slightly exaggerated scientific fact .
Ses04M_script02_2_M003 i m not the only one . look at these people .
Ses04M_script02_2_M004 are we talking about the same thing ?
Ses04M_script02_2_M005 carla can i ask you something ? don t take this the wrong way but are you having your period ?
Ses04M_script02_2_M006 well what s bugging you ?
Ses04M_script02_2_M007 there s nothing to it . we come down here . the grunions arrive . they do their little fish business . we go ooh ah look at the fish . they go home . we go home .
Ses04M_script02_2_M008 why not ?
Ses04M_script02_2_M009 we ve missed them twice .
Ses04M_script02_2_M010 that s not ever .
Ses04M_script02_2_M011 we ll see them this year .
Ses04M_script02_2_M012 i thought you wanted to see them .
Ses04M_script02_2_M013 no of course not .
Ses04M_script02_2_M014 it s just fish nothing to get traumatized over .
Ses04M_script02_2_M015 i ve been trying to work this backwards but i can t seem to pinpoint the moment when we took a turn for the worse .
Ses04M_script02_2_M016 you were fine during the phone call from marge . dinner was okay . doing the dishes was no problem . let s see i took a shower . uh you watched the news . you said the grunions are running tonight . i said great let s go . i feel lucky tonight .

Ses04M_script02_2_M030 no i m just like you . i thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and wind in our hair and sand in our toes and the fish will always come and the bills will always pay themselves .
Ses04M_script02_2_M031 and we ll have three fat rosy kids and ha ha ha baby the joke s on us cause you know what you get carla ? you know what you get ? this .

Ses04M_script02_2_M041 shh . if we re very quiet the fish might come .
Ses04M_script02_2_M042 or not .
Ses05M_script03_2_F000 oh you knew there was nothing in that .
Ses05M_script03_2_F001 only a trivial little broach .
Ses05M_script03_2_F002 not at all . i quite like it . i wear it often .
Ses05M_script03_2_F003  garbage no i didn t . you worked the whole thing up in your jealous imagination .
Ses05M_script03_2_F004 oh maybe a little . nothing serious .
Ses05M_script03_2_F005 well what of it .
Ses05M_script03_2_F006 well it gave him a lot of pleasure and it didn t hurt me .
Ses05M_script03_2_F007 well if you hadn t been so nosey and suspicious you never would have known about it .
Ses05M_script03_2_F008 i m getting very bored with this conversation .

Ses05M_script03_2_F010 i don t see why you want it you ve already had two glasses .
Ses05M_script03_2_F011 well it seems silly to go on and on with such a thing .

Ses05M_script03_2_F013 don t be stupid .
Ses05M_script03_2_F014 what ?
Ses05M_script03_2_F015 just making myself fascinating for you .

Ses05M_script03_2_F023 yes i did quite a lot .
Ses05M_script03_2_F024  laughter mind your own business .
Ses05M_script03_2_F025 you re quite insufferable . i do imagine it s because you re drunk .
Ses05M_script03_2_F026 you always had a weak head .
Ses05M_script03_2_F027 oh no on the contrary a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass .
Ses05M_script03_2_F028 not would you shut up .
Ses05M_script03_2_F029 you re not very funny dear . you better have some more brandy .
Ses05M_script03_2_F030 why ?
Ses05M_script03_2_F031 there aren t any people upstairs . it s a photography studio .
Ses05M_script03_2_F032 they re away in tunis .
Ses05M_script03_2_F033 turn it on again please .
Ses05M_script03_2_F034 very well . if you have to be boorish and idiotic .
Ses05M_script03_2_F035 you are far too temperamental . try to control yourself .
Ses05M_script03_2_F036 go away ! go away ! i i hate you .
Ses05M_script03_2_F037 you know what i m sick and tire of listening to you . you re a you re a total sadistic bully .
Ses05M_script03_2_F038 stop . would you just go away ? i mean you re conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible .
Ses05M_script03_2_F039 this is the end ! do you understand me ? this is the end .
Ses05M_script03_2_F040 yes i am . let go with me
Ses05M_script03_2_F041 you are a cruel fiend and i i loath you . i thank god i realized who you are before i decided to marry you again . oh my god never !
Ses05M_script03_2_F042 beast
Ses05M_script03_2_F043 brute
Ses05M_script03_2_F044 pig
Ses05M_script03_2_M000 come to think of it the real cause of that roue was peter burden .
Ses05M_script03_2_M001 i knew nothing of the sort . you accepted presents from him .
Ses05M_script03_2_M002 i remember it well covered in diamonds and the worst possible taste .
Ses05M_script03_2_M003 you went out of your way to torture me over peter burden .
Ses05M_script03_2_M004 you must admit that he was in love with you . wasn t he ?
Ses05M_script03_2_M005 he let him kiss you . you said you did .
Ses05M_script03_2_M006 what of it ?
Ses05M_script03_2_M007 what about me ?
Ses05M_script03_2_M008 well that s a nice point of view i must say .
Ses05M_script03_2_M009 me too bored stiff .
Ses05M_script03_2_M010 do you want some brandy ?
Ses05M_script03_2_M011 i think i ll have a little .
Ses05M_script03_2_M012 no particular reason . besides they were little ones .
Ses05M_script03_2_M013 you can hardly say you can hardly call three little liquor glasses of brandy for the entire evening going on and on .
Ses05M_script03_2_M014 you needn t be so grand simply because you don t happen to want me at the moment .
Ses05M_script03_2_M015 amanda really .
Ses05M_script03_2_M016 nothing . are you going out somewhere darling ?
Ses05M_script03_2_M017 um well that reply has just broken my heart .
Ses05M_script03_2_M018 oh as a matter of fact that s perfectly true .
Ses05M_script03_2_M019 yes it is .
Ses05M_script03_2_M020 it s a pity you didn t have a little bit more brandy . it might have made you a little less disagreeable .
Ses05M_script03_2_M021 oh snap snap snap . like a little adder .
Ses05M_script03_2_M022 nonsense they ve got a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap !
Ses05M_script03_2_M023 they snap .
Ses05M_script03_2_M024 so did you see much of peter burden after the divorce ?
Ses05M_script03_2_M025 you must have let him kiss you quite a good deal more then huh ?
Ses05M_script03_2_M026 i m sure you had a riotous time no restrain at all very enjoyable . you never had much anyway .
Ses05M_script03_2_M027 i am not the slightest bit drunk .
Ses05M_script03_2_M028 i do believe that i have said already that i had three minuet liquor glasses of brandy in the entire evening . a child of two couldn t get drunk of that .
Ses05M_script03_2_M029 oh really ? how about a child of three or child of six what about a child of nine ?
Ses05M_script03_2_M030 you know we could get a really good debate going on about this . you know intemperate tots .
Ses05M_script03_2_M031 you know what ? that s a very good idea . i think i will .
Ses05M_script03_2_M032 you better turn that off i think .
Ses05M_script03_2_M033 because it s very late and you ll disturb the people upstairs .
Ses05M_script03_2_M034 well there are people downstairs i suppose .
Ses05M_script03_2_M035 this is no time of the year for tunis .
Ses05M_script03_2_M036 i do i shall do no such thing .
Ses05M_script03_2_M037 turn it off . it s driving me mad .
Ses05M_script03_2_M038 turn it off !
Ses05M_script03_2_M039 very amusing indeed .
Ses05M_script03_2_M040 ja ! very funny .
Ses05M_script03_2_M041 you are a vile tempered wicked living evil little beast . and i hope i never set eyes on you ever again .
Ses05M_script03_2_M042 oh you re not going like this .
Ses05M_script03_2_M043  garbage no you re not .
Ses05M_script03_2_M044 oh ! marry you again ? i wouldn t marry you again if you came crawling to me on bended knee .
Ses05M_script03_2_M045 you re a wicked little vampire . and i pray to god i never set eyes on you again as long as i live .
Ses05F_script01_3_F000 you re the only one i know who loves his parents .
Ses05F_script01_3_F001 no it s good .
Ses05F_script01_3_F002 it s so lovely here . the air is sweet .
Ses05F_script01_3_F003 no . but i m not going to stay .
Ses05F_script01_3_F004 well your mother has much as told me to leave .
Ses05F_script01_3_F005 well you saw that ! and you . you ve been 
Ses05F_script01_3_F006 well sort of embarrassed soon as i came .
Ses05F_script01_3_F007 i figured they would your mother at least .
Ses05F_script01_3_F008 well from her point of view why else would i come ?
Ses05F_script01_3_F009 i guess this is why i came .
Ses05F_script01_3_F010 chris i ve been ready for a long time .
Ses05F_script01_3_F011 i almost got married two years ago .

Ses05F_script01_3_F014 well i was waiting for you ! i mean i didn t until then you hadn t written and when you write when you wrote what did you say ? i mean you sure can be ambiguous chris .
Ses05F_script01_3_F015 i ll never forgive you . why did you wait so long ? all this time i ve been wondering if i was a fool for thinking of you !

Ses05F_script01_3_F018 no what is it your mother ?
Ses05F_script01_3_F019 what is it ? even in your letters there is something ashamed .
Ses05F_script01_3_F020 it wouldn t work like this .
Ses05F_script01_3_F021 yeah sure .
Ses05F_script01_3_F022 how many ?
Ses05F_script01_3_F023 oh gee .

Ses05F_script01_3_F026 what would i do with a fortune ?
Ses05F_script01_3_M000 i know . it s going out of style isn t it ?
Ses05F_script01_3_M001 so you re not sorry you came ?
Ses05F_script01_3_M002 why ?
Ses05F_script01_3_M003 well 
Ses05F_script01_3_M004 what ?
Ses05F_script01_3_M005 well the plan was to kind of sneak up on you over a period of a week or so . but uh they take it for granted that we re all set .
Ses05F_script01_3_M006 how did you know ?
Ses05F_script01_3_M007 well would you want to ? i guess you know this is why i asked you to come .
Ses05F_script01_3_M008 anne i love you . i love you a great deal . i love you !
Ses05F_script01_3_M009 i i i have no imagination that s all i know what to say i i m embarrassing you . i i didn t want to tell you here . i wanted it to be some place different some place where we could be new to each other you know .
Ses05F_script01_3_M010 you feel it s wrong here don t you this yard this chair ? i want you to be ready for me annie . i don t want to win you away from anything .
Ses05F_script01_3_M011 then he s gone forever you re sure ?
Ses05F_script01_3_M012 why didn t you ?
Ses05F_script01_3_M013 you felt something that far back ?
Ses05F_script01_3_M014 annie why didn t you say something to me ?
Ses05F_script01_3_M015 give me a kiss ann . give me a 
Ses05F_script01_3_M016 oh god i kissed annie ! i can t believe i kissed annie ! how long i ve wanted to do this .
Ses05F_script01_3_M017 oh annie we re going to live now . i m going to make you so happy .
Ses05F_script01_3_M018 i kissed you .
Ses05F_script01_3_M019 let s let s drive someplace . i i want to be alone with you .
Ses05F_script01_3_M020 no nothing like that .
Ses05F_script01_3_M021 yeah i suppose i have been . but it s going from me .
Ses05F_script01_3_M022 i don t know how to start .
Ses05F_script01_3_M023 it s it s mixed up with so many other things i 
Ses05F_script01_3_M024 remember when i was overseas ? i was in command of the company .
Ses05F_script01_3_M025 yeah . i lost them .
Ses05F_script01_3_M026 just about all .
Ses05F_script01_3_M027 takes a little time to toss something like that off you know because they weren t just men 
Ses05F_script01_3_M028 for instance there s this one time . it had been raining for several days . and this kid came up to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks . you know he just put them in my pocket .
Ses05F_script01_3_M029 i know that that s not a big thing but it s just the kind of guys i had . they didn t die . they they killed themselves for each other .
Ses05F_script01_3_M030 i mean that exactly that a little more selfish and they would have still been here today .
Ses05F_script01_3_M031 and i got an ideal watching them all go down . everything was being destroyed see and 
Ses05F_script01_3_M032 but it seemed to me that something new was being created at the same time a kind of responsibility man for man . do you understand me ?
Ses05F_script01_3_M033 and to show that to to bring that back onto the earth again like a like a monument . and everyone would have it standing behind them and and it would make a difference for them .
Ses05F_script01_3_M034 and then i went home and it was incredible . it had no meaning here .
Ses05F_script01_3_M035 it was all like some kind of bus accident to them . i went back to work with my dad in that whole rat race again .
Ses05F_script01_3_M036 and i felt what you said ashamed somehow because nobody had changed at all . it seemed to make suckers out of a whole lot of guys . and
Ses05F_script01_3_M037 it felt wrong to be alive to open that bank book to buy that new car to look at that new refrigerator . i mean you can take those things out of the war but if you drive that car you have to know that that comes from the love that a man has for a man . and you ve got to be a little bit better than that !
Ses05F_script01_3_M038 and if you re not then it s all just loot and it s got blood on it and i don t want any of it ! and i guess that included you .
Ses05F_script01_3_M039 i i want you now annie .
Ses05F_script01_3_M040 oh annie . annie i am going to make you a fortune !
Ses05M_impro03_F000 what ?
Ses05M_impro03_F001 what ? you did ?
Ses05M_impro03_F002 when ?
Ses05M_impro03_F003 oh what how where how did you do it ?
Ses05M_impro03_F004 okay good . i i assumed .

Ses05M_impro03_M033 thank you .
Ses05M_script02_2_F000 about what ?
Ses05M_script02_2_F001 it s ridiculous .
Ses05M_script02_2_F002 it s p .r . somebody sold you a bill of goods that this magical thing would be happening on the beach .
Ses05M_script02_2_F003 sure . everybody is told the same thing it keeps us all excited . it keeps us all coming back for more . it keeps us thinking that life is gonna start now any minute if we can just find the right spot and get in on the action .
Ses05M_script02_2_F004 i m sorry . it s just it s it s just fish to me .
Ses05M_script02_2_F005 god damn it augie . seriously you always ask me that . why do you ask me that ? i hate it . it s so insulting .
Ses05M_script02_2_F006 i just we just have different ideas of what this night is suppose to look like .
Ses05M_script02_2_F007 for god s sake augie . it s grow up we re not going to see the grunion .
Ses05M_script02_2_F008 we we don t ever . have we ever ?
Ses05M_script02_2_F009 twice is every time we ve tried that s ever
Ses05M_script02_2_F010 no we won t . it s like waiting up for santa clause or something . i feel like as though my whole life is going to be standing on the beach waiting with my eyes opened expectantly my hands clasped neatly in front of me waiting for fish to show up . and the fish will not show up .
Ses05M_script02_2_F011 you don t understand anything i am saying .
Ses05M_script02_2_F012 i did want to see it . i always want to see it . i just i keep thinking this will be the time and it never is .
Ses05M_script02_2_F013 do you remember the first time that we came to see the grunion ? it was about four years ago right after we got married . we thought i was pregnant . we had a bottle of champagne and no glasses . you asked me to dance . we took off our shoes . and while we were dancing you said the most intimate things to me right in my ear so i could feel them as much as hear them .
Ses05M_script02_2_F014 and i remember thinking to myself finally . i am as happy as i am supposed to be .
Ses05M_script02_2_F015 dancing barefoot in the sand drinking champagne out of the bottle .
Ses05M_script02_2_F016 i would rather not remember some things . i d rather not hope for something .
Ses05M_script02_2_F017 no .
Ses05M_script02_2_F018 no .
Ses05M_script02_2_F019 no .
Ses05M_script02_2_F020  laughter no .
Ses05M_script02_2_F021 no .
Ses05M_script02_2_F022 no .
Ses05M_script02_2_F023 i just want i just want things to turn out the way they are supposed to .
Ses05M_script02_2_F024 this ? what is this ? this isn t even anything .
Ses05M_script02_2_F025 sure this is standing on the beach . this is waiting . this is fighting .
Ses05M_script02_2_F026 but this isn t at all what i wanted it to be .
Ses05M_script02_2_F027 this is just this . i mean it s a lot and everything . but it s not you know something else . am i making any sense ?
Ses05M_script02_2_F028 i know that augie . i do . i know that . and and i know that this meant a lot to you and and it s special you know with the sand and the moon but .
Ses05M_script02_2_F029 but i just couldn t help thinking about being somewhere else .
Ses05M_script02_2_F030 i didn t say that .
Ses05M_script02_2_F031 for heavens sake augie whatever i am doing i d rather it be with you .
Ses05M_script02_2_F032 yes . don t you know that ? i mean you re probably the one you wishes you were with somebody else somebody who didn t take everything so hard and who knew how to enjoy herself .
Ses05M_script02_2_F033 okay . well we re in the wrong spot but we re with the right person .
Ses05M_script02_2_F034 yes i did notice that . it does look really beautiful over the water . big old white moon .
Ses05M_script02_2_F035 augie you brought refreshments .
Ses05M_script02_2_F036 well then we don t need glasses .
Ses05M_script02_2_F037 no . i m beginning to think you might be right . i think this might be the spot after all . augie i m sorry .
Ses05M_script02_2_F038 or not .
Ses05M_script02_2_M000 well so what do you think ?
Ses05M_script02_2_M001 what i was just saying .
Ses05M_script02_2_M002 it certainly is not . it s slightly exaggerated scientific fact .
Ses05M_script02_2_M003 i m not the only one look at all these people .
Ses05M_script02_2_M004 are we talking about the same thing ?
Ses05M_script02_2_M005 uh carla can i ask you a question ? no don t get upset but are you having your period ?
Ses05M_script02_2_M006 what s bugging you then ?
Ses05M_script02_2_M007 it s not that complicated . we come down here the grunions arrive they do their little fish thing . we say ooh awe look at the little fish . and then they go home and we go home .
Ses05M_script02_2_M008 why not ?
Ses05M_script02_2_M009 we ve missed them twice . that s hardly ever .
Ses05M_script02_2_M010 well we ll see them this year .
Ses05M_script02_2_M011 okey they re just fish . it s nothing to get traumatized over .
Ses05M_script02_2_M012 no of course not .
Ses05M_script02_2_M013 i m trying to work this backwards . but i can t seem to pinpoint the time where everything went wrong here . okay so 
Ses05M_script02_2_M014 you were fine on the phone call with marge eating dinner was fine talking uh washing the dishes no problem . all right . so i m taking a shower you re watching tv the news and you say the grunions are running tonight and i say great let s go . i m feeling lucky . and so all right and i m putting on my coat i m putting out the animals i m pulling the car out of the garage .
Ses05M_script02_2_M015 wait a minute . i ve got it .
Ses05M_script02_2_M016 it was in the car right ? when we were passing knickerbocker liquor locker you said let s stop and get champagne . and i said that times a wasting or something like that right ? you wanted it to be like it was before right ?
Ses05M_script02_2_M017 okay . all right no problem . i totally understand . okey um listen . do you want to dance ?
Ses05M_script02_2_M018 do you want me to go get some champagne ?

Ses05M_script02_2_M023 a poodle a backrub a spa a suicide pack ? what carla what the hell do you want ?
Ses05M_script02_2_M024 well welcome to the human race . do you think this is what i had planned ? do you think that when i proposed that i had this great fantasy going that four years down the road we would end up arguing on the beach over some fish ?
Ses05M_script02_2_M025 do you think that i thought there would be times when you would look at me like i was used kleenex or i would look at you and think good god when s the next flight to alaska ? no . no i m just like you . i thought it would all be like peaches and roses and sand in our toes and wind in our hair and the fish would always come . and the bills would magically pay themselves . and we d have three fat rosy kids . but ha ha baby the jokes on us !
Ses05M_script02_2_M026 because you know what you get carla ? you know what you get ? this .
Ses05M_script02_2_M027 yes it is .
Ses05M_script02_2_M028 right .

Ses05M_script03_1_F007 i shall probably do a court curtsey .
Ses05M_script03_1_F008 what s so horrible is that one can t stay happy .
Ses05M_script03_1_F009 well it s true . the whole business is a very poor joke .
Ses05M_script03_1_F010 meaning just that .
Ses05M_script03_1_F011 don t laugh at me . i m serious .
Ses05M_script03_1_F012 who s they ?
Ses05M_script03_1_F013 if i laugh at everything then i must laugh at us too .
Ses05M_script03_1_F014 oh how long will it last this ludicrous overbearing love of ours ?
Ses05M_script03_1_F015 well will we always bicker and fight ?
Ses05M_script03_1_F016 oh dear . shall we like that ?
Ses05M_script03_1_F017 what if one of us dies does the other one laugh then ?
Ses05M_script03_1_F018 that s rather serious isn t it ?

Ses05M_script03_1_F024 i know you did . you threw it out the window into the canal below . i don t think i ll ever forgive you for that .
Ses05M_script03_1_F025 it went on intermittently for days .
Ses05M_script03_1_F026 oh it burnt my comb and all the towels in the bathroom .
Ses05M_script03_1_F027 that was the first time you hit me .
Ses05M_script03_1_F028 and then the manager came in and saw us all rolling all over the floor biting and scratching one another . laughter 
Ses05M_script03_1_F029 how ridiculous utterly ridiculous
Ses05M_script03_1_F030 very much sillier .
Ses05M_script03_1_F031 you knew there was nothing in that .

Ses05M_script03_1_M008 uhh it s amazing how once you feel 
Ses05M_script03_1_M009 things that ought to matter most dreadfully don t matter at all when one s happy do they ?

Ses05M_script03_1_M014 all the futile mortals who try to make life unbearable . laugh at them be flippant . laugh at everything all their sacred shibboleths .
Ses05M_script03_1_M015 uh the being flippant brings out the acid in their damned beauty and light .
Ses05M_script03_1_M016 certainly you must . we are figures of fun all right .
Ses05M_script03_1_M017  garbage who knows ?
Ses05M_script03_1_M018 no . that fire will fade along with our passion .
Ses05M_script03_1_M019 well it depends on how well we played .
Ses05M_script03_1_M020 yes yes with all his might .
Ses05M_script03_1_M021 no no that is quit laughable . the cutting little mystery all done with mirrors .
Ses05M_script03_1_M022 so is everyone else in the long run . let s be superficial and pity the poor philosophers . let s blow trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as long as we can like little quiet idiotic school children .
Ses05M_script03_1_M023  garbage darling kiss me before your body rots and worms start popping in and out of your eye sockets .
Ses05M_script03_1_M024 i don t care what you do . see you could paint your body bright green and and run naked through the place vendome and run with every man in the world and i shan t say a word . as long as i know that you love me best .
Ses05M_script03_1_M025 do you remember that awful scene we had in venice ?
Ses05M_script03_1_M026 the one where you bought that little painted wooden stake and you put it on my bed .
Ses05M_script03_1_M027 horrible thing . i hated it .
Ses05M_script03_1_M028 how long did that roue last ?
Ses05M_script03_1_M029 oh the worst one was in cannes when your curling iron burnt a hole in my new dressing gown ?
Ses05M_script03_1_M030  laughter that was quit a rouser wasn t it ?
Ses05M_script03_1_M031 oh i didn t hit you very hard .
Ses05M_script03_1_M032 i should never forget his face . laughter 
Ses05M_script03_1_M033 we were very much younger then .
Ses05M_script03_1_M034 come to think of it the real cause of that roues was peter burden .
Ses05M_script01_1b_F000 what s he going to say ? maybe we ought to tell him before he sees it .
Ses05M_script01_1b_F001 what do you mean ? i was the first one up he was still in bed .
Ses05M_script01_1b_F002 when ?
Ses05M_script01_1b_F003 what was he doing out here four in the morning ?
Ses05M_script01_1b_F004 did you talk to him ?
Ses05M_script01_1b_F005 he s dreaming about him again . he s getting just like after larry died . what s the meaning of that ?
Ses05M_script01_1b_F006 what ?
Ses05M_script01_1b_F007 what do you mean dishonest ?
Ses05M_script01_1b_F008 what are you gonna do argue with him ?
Ses05M_script01_1b_F009 well how are you gonna prove it ? can you prove it ?
Ses05M_script01_1b_F010 to you it is and to me but not to him .
Ses05M_script01_1b_F011 you can talk yourself blue in the face but there s no body and there s no grave . so where are you ?
Ses05M_script01_1b_F012 the trouble is the god damn newspapers i mean ea each week a new boy turns up out of nowhere . so the next one is gonna be larry . so you 
Ses05M_script01_1b_F013 why ?
Ses05M_script01_1b_F014 well i ve got an idea but what s the story ?
Ses05M_script01_1b_F015 well that s your business chris .
Ses05M_script01_1b_F016 what do you want me to do ? i mean you re old enough to know your own mind .
Ses05M_script01_1b_F017 well you want to make sure that your father isn t gonna 
Ses05M_script01_1b_F018 i ignore what i got to ignore . i mean the girl is larry s girl .
Ses05M_script01_1b_F019 as far as your father is concerned he s not dead . and she s still his girl .
Ses05M_script01_1b_F020 now you can go on with this if you know where to go but i don t know where to go .
Ses05M_script01_1b_F021 well you re a considerate fella . there s nothing wrong with that .
Ses05M_script01_1b_F022 have you asked annie yet ?
Ses05M_script01_1b_F023 well how do you know she ll marry you ? maybe she feels like your father does .
Ses05M_script01_1b_F024 the trouble is you don t see enough women . you never did .
Ses05M_script01_1b_F025 i just don t see why it has to be annie .
Ses05M_script01_1b_F026 well that s a good reason . but it don t mean a thing . i mean you haven t seen her since you went to war . it s been five years .
Ses05M_script01_1b_F027 no i don t want a your father thinks he s coming back chris . if you marry that girl you re pronouncing him dead .
Ses05M_script01_1b_F028 now what s going to happen to your father do you know ? i don t .
Ses05M_script01_1b_F029 just give it some more thought .
Ses05M_script01_1b_F030 what the hell is this ?
Ses05M_script01_1b_F031 are you crazy ?
Ses05M_script01_1b_F032 but you have a business here . what the hell is this ?
Ses05M_script01_1b_F033 must you be inspired ?
Ses05M_script01_1b_F034 you don t want to think like that .
Ses05M_script01_1b_F035 all right . but don t think like that because what the hell did we work for chris ? all of this all of it it s all just for you .
Ses05M_script01_1b_F036 don t think like that do you hear me ?
Ses05M_script01_1b_F037 i don t understand you do i ?
Ses05M_script01_1b_F038 yeah i can see that .
Ses05M_script01_1b_M000 he saw it .
Ses05M_script01_1b_M001 he was out here when it broke .
Ses05M_script01_1b_M002 about four this morning . i heard it crack and i looked out the window and he was standing right there when it cracked .
Ses05M_script01_1b_M003 i don t know . but after he saw it he ran back into the house and started crying in the kitchen .
Ses05M_script01_1b_M004 no . i figured it was best to leave him alone .
Ses05M_script01_1b_M005 yes yes he is . i don t know the meaning in it . but i know one thing mom we made a terrible mistake with dad .
Ses05M_script01_1b_M006 being dishonest with him . it s the kind of thing that pays off and now it s paying off .
Ses05M_script01_1b_M007 you know that larry s not coming back and i know it . so why do we go on letting him think that we believe with him ?
Ses05M_script01_1b_M008 i don t want to argue with him . but it s time that he knows that nobody else believes that larry s alive . i mean
Ses05M_script01_1b_M009 why shouldn t he dream about him walk the nights waiting for him ? do we contradict him ? do we say outright that we don t have any hope anymore ? that we haven t had any hope for a long time ?
Ses05M_script01_1b_M010 for gods sake three years ! nobody comes back after three years . it s insane !
Ses05M_script01_1b_M011 sit down mom . i want to talk to you .

Ses05M_script01_1b_M017 so it s all right then ? i should just go ahead with it ?
Ses05M_script01_1b_M018 so it isn t just my business ? you infuriate me sometime you know that .
Ses05M_script01_1b_M019 isn t it your business too if i tell dad and he throws a fit about it ? you have such a talent for ignoring things .
Ses05M_script01_1b_M020 she s not larry s girl .
Ses05M_script01_1b_M021 i don t know why it is but every time i reach out for something that i want i have to pull back because it might hurt somebody else my whole bloody life time after time after time .
Ses05M_script01_1b_M022 what to hell with that !
Ses05M_script01_1b_M023 i wanted to get this settled first .
Ses05M_script01_1b_M024 well if she does then that s the end of it . but from her letters it seems like she s forgotten him .
Ses05M_script01_1b_M025 i ll find out and then we ll thrash it out with dad all right ? mom don t avoid me .
Ses05M_script01_1b_M026 so what i m not fast with women ?
Ses05M_script01_1b_M027 because it is .
Ses05M_script01_1b_M028  garbage i don t know . it s just 
Ses05M_script01_1b_M029 she s who i know best . i know her since i i was a kid i grew up with her . when i think of somebody for my wife these days i i think of annie . what do you want a diagram ?

Ses05M_script01_1b_M033 i ll get out . i ll go get married someplace else i i ll live someplace else maybe new york .
Ses05M_script01_1b_M034 i ve been a good son for too long a good sucker . i m through with it .
Ses05M_script01_1b_M035 the business ? the business doesn t inspire me .

Ses05M_script01_3_F003 well your mother first of all pretty much told me to leave .
Ses05M_script01_3_F004 you saw that . and well you ve been 
Ses05M_script01_3_F005 you ve been sort of embarrassed since i got here .
Ses05M_script01_3_F006 i figured they would your mother at least .
Ses05M_script01_3_F007 well from her perspective i mean why else would i come here ?
Ses05M_script01_3_F008 yes that s why i came .
Ses05M_script01_3_F009 oh chris i ve been ready for a long time .
Ses05M_script01_3_F010 i almost got married two years ago .
Ses05M_script01_3_F011 you started to write me .
Ses05M_script01_3_F012 everyday since .
Ses05M_script01_3_F013 well i mean until then you never wrote and when you did what did you say ? i mean you sure can be ambiguous .
Ses05M_script01_3_F014 i ll never forgive you . why did you wait so long ? all this time i ve sat around wondering if i was crazy for thinking of you .
Ses05M_script01_3_F015 not like that you re not .

Ses05M_script01_3_F019 even in your letters there was something ashamed .
Ses05M_script01_3_F020 you have to tell me .

Ses05M_script01_3_F022 yeah sure .
Ses05M_script01_3_F023 how many ?
Ses05M_script01_3_F024 do you still feel like that ?
Ses05M_script01_3_F025 because you can t feel like that anymore chris . because everything you have you have a right to me included .
Ses05M_script01_3_F026 and you father he put hundreds of planes in the air and you should be proud . a man should be paid for that .
Ses05M_script01_3_F027  laughter what will i do with a fortune ?

Ses05M_script01_3_M001 so you re not sorry i came ?
Ses05M_script01_3_M002 why ?
Ses05M_script01_3_M003 well 
Ses05M_script01_3_M004 what ?
Ses05M_script01_3_M005 well i planned on kind of sneaking up on you in a period of a week or so but they all take it for granted that we re set .
Ses05M_script01_3_M006 how did you know ?
Ses05M_script01_3_M007 well so would you want to ? i mean i guess you know that s why i asked you to come .

Ses05M_script01_3_M009 i don t know what to say . i have no imagination . that s all i have to say to you . god i m embarrassing you . i i didn t want to do this here . i i wanted to do it someplace different someplace where we could be new to each other .
Ses05M_script01_3_M010 you feel it s wrong here don t you this yard this chair ? i want you to be ready for me annie . i i don t want to win you away from anything .
Ses05M_script01_3_M011 so he s gone forever then ? you sure ?
Ses05M_script01_3_M012 why didn t you ?
Ses05M_script01_3_M013 you felt something that far back ?
Ses05M_script01_3_M014 annie why didn t you call me or tell me ?
Ses05M_script01_3_M015 give me a kiss annie . give me a 
Ses05M_script01_3_M016 oh god i kissed annie . i kissed annie . i can t how long have i waited to do that ?
Ses05M_script01_3_M017 oh annie we re gonna live now . i m going to make you so happy .
Ses05M_script01_3_M018 i kissed you .
Ses05M_script01_3_M019 lets go for a ride . i i i want to be alone with you .
Ses05M_script01_3_M020 no nothing like that .
Ses05M_script01_3_M021 yeah i suppose i have been . but it s going for me .
Ses05M_script01_3_M022 i don t i don t know where to start .
Ses05M_script01_3_M023 it s so mixed up with so many other things .
Ses05M_script01_3_M024 you remember when i was overseas i was in command of a company ?
Ses05M_script01_3_M025 i lost them .
Ses05M_script01_3_M026 just about all .
Ses05M_script01_3_M027 it it takes time to toss something like that off i mean because they weren t just men .
Ses05M_script01_3_M028 for instance there was this time and it had been raining for several days and this kid came up to me and he gave me his last pair of dry socks just put them in my pocket .
Ses05M_script01_3_M029 i know it s it s just a little thing but that s just the kind of guys i had . they didn t die . they killed themselves for each other .
Ses05M_script01_3_M030 i mean that exactly anymore selfish just a little bit more selfish and they would have been here today . and it gave me an idea as i was watching them all go down .
Ses05M_script01_3_M031 everything was being destroyed see but i felt like something new was being created at the same time . like it kind of responsibility . you know man to man . do you understand what i m saying ?
Ses05M_script01_3_M032 and and to see that again to to bring that back on the earth again like like a monument that that would stand behind these men and and and it would make a difference to them .
Ses05M_script01_3_M033 it was and then i went home . and it was incredible . it didn t have any meaning there .
Ses05M_script01_3_M034 i mean the whole thing was like some kind of bus accident to them .
Ses05M_script01_3_M035 so i went back to work for my dad and that whole rat race again .
Ses05M_script01_3_M036 i felt what you said ashamed somehow because nobody had changed at all .
Ses05M_script01_3_M037 it seemed to make suckers out of so many guys . and i i felt wrong to be alive to to open that bank book to to drive that car the new car and look at that new refrigerator . i mean 
Ses05M_script01_3_M038 you can take those things out of the war but if you re gonna drive that car you ve got to know that that came from the love a man can have from a man . and you ve got to be a little bit better because of that . because if you re not then it s all just loot and there s blood on it and i didn t want any of it .
Ses05M_script01_3_M039 and i guess that included you .
Ses05M_script01_3_M040 i want you now annie .
Ses05M_script01_3_M041 oh annie 
Ses05M_script01_3_M042 annie i am going to make you a fortune .
Ses05M_script01_2_F000 why did you invite her here ?
Ses05M_script01_2_F001 she s been in new york three and a half years why all of a sudden ?
Ses05M_script01_2_F002 nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see .
Ses05M_script01_2_F003 he s not going to marry her .
Ses05M_script01_2_F004 he s got that about it .
Ses05M_script01_2_F005 what s going on here joe ?
Ses05M_script01_2_F006 no . she s not his girl joe . she knows she s not .
Ses05M_script01_2_F007 then why is she still single ? i mean new york is full of men . why isn t she married ? probably a hundred people told her she s foolish but she s waited .
Ses05M_script01_2_F008 because she knows what i know that s why . she s faithful as a rock . in my worst moments i think of her waiting and i know again that i m right .
Ses05M_script01_2_F009 nobody in this house dares takes her faith away joe . strangers might but not his father not his brother .
Ses05M_script01_2_F010 i want you to pretend like he s coming back . both of you don t think i haven t noticed you and chris since she s gotten here . i don t want any nonsense .
Ses05M_script01_2_F011 no because if she he s not coming back then i ll kill myself . laugh ! laugh at me !
Ses05M_script01_2_F012 but why did that happen the very night she came back ? she goes to sleep in his bed and his memorial breaks in pieces . look at it .
Ses05M_script01_2_F013 believe with me joe . i can t stand alone .
Ses05M_script01_2_F014 only last week a man turned up in detroit missing longer than larry . you read it yourself .
Ses05M_script01_2_F015 you above all have got to believe .
Ses05M_script01_2_F016 just don t stop believing .
Ses05M_script01_2_F017 i can t help it .
Ses05M_script01_2_M000 why does that bother you ?
Ses05M_script01_2_M001 well maybe maybe he just wanted to see her again .
Ses05M_script01_2_M002 what are you talking about ? he grew up next to the girl his whole life why wouldn t he want to see her again ? don t look at me like that . he hasn t told me anything he didn t told you .
Ses05M_script01_2_M003 why do you think he s even thinking that ?
Ses05M_script01_2_M004 well so what ?
Ses05M_script01_2_M005 now listen .
Ses05M_script01_2_M006 you don t know . you can t read her mind .
Ses05M_script01_2_M007 how do you know why she s waited ?
Ses05M_script01_2_M008 look it s a beautiful day outside why are we arguing ?
Ses05M_script01_2_M009 well what do you want me to do about it ? what do you want ?
Ses05M_script01_2_M010 but kate ?

Ses05F_script02_1_F004 i mean you keep saying my flashlight as if it s somehow just yours . how s that suppose to make me feel ?
Ses05F_script02_1_F005 yes .
Ses05F_script02_1_F006 i am cold .
Ses05F_script02_1_F007 it s after eleven let s go home .
Ses05F_script02_1_F008 there is no point in coming out here .

Ses05F_script02_1_F010 so let s go .
Ses05F_script02_1_F011 not particularly .
Ses05F_script02_1_F012 i just don t .
Ses05F_script02_1_F013 pass up what ? its little fish one month on the beach and they flop around and they swim away and then they die .
Ses05F_script02_1_F014 what are you so excited about ? i mean it s not it s not rocket science we are talking about its fish . its fish nobody even eats .
Ses05F_script02_1_F015 i am just not .
Ses05F_script02_1_F016 yes .
Ses05F_script02_1_F017 last year you also remember our shoes got wet and i got sand in my panties and we got into a big fight . you had a sore throat and we did not see the grunions .
Ses05F_script02_1_F018 we didn t see them the first time either .
Ses05F_script02_1_F019 that s the wind .
Ses05F_script02_1_M000 what time is it ? isn t it supposed to start running around midnight ? this is great isn t it ? look at this great night we got here . couldn t be better 
Ses05F_script02_1_M001 actually i was hoping to go a little bit further up the coast to get away from the lights and the people but i was afraid i will miss it . how are you doing ?
Ses05F_script02_1_M002 is that no no no is that foam ? i can t even tell although if i if i can t tell it probably isn t it ? right it ll probably be unmistakable but don t you think ? how you doing ?
Ses05F_script02_1_M003 oh no you know what i did . i forgot my flashlight . how could i be so stupid ? i can t believe i forgot my flashlight .
Ses05F_script02_1_M004 the flashlight the silver one there s only one isn t there ?
Ses05F_script02_1_M005 whose is it ?
Ses05F_script02_1_M006 well sure .
Ses05F_script02_1_M007 no of course you are right . our flashlight . me flashlight is you flashlight naturally . how can we not think to bring it ?
Ses05F_script02_1_M008 well i hope the moon stays out . well i wonder do they always wander during a full moon ? i can t remember wasn t it full last year ? do you remember ?
Ses05F_script02_1_M009 are you cold ? you want my jacket ? we should have bought a blanket . our blanket . this is great isn t it ?
Ses05F_script02_1_M010 i didn t even think to bring a six pack . a six pack would be just the thing right about now . i can t believe i forgot . and look at kid i am surprise i make it out of the house about flies it .
Ses05F_script02_1_M011  laughter i wonder if they can hear me talk or if they can feel the vibration in the sand when we are moving around
Ses05F_script02_1_M012 you want my jacket ?
Ses05F_script02_1_M013 are you kidding ? we d miss it . we just got here what s the point of coming out here if we are just going to leave .
Ses05F_script02_1_M014 right .
Ses05F_script02_1_M015 that s my point too .
Ses05F_script02_1_M016 no no no . that s not my point . my point is what s the point in coming down here if we are just going to turn around and go home . don t you want to see it ?
Ses05F_script02_1_M017 why not ?
Ses05F_script02_1_M018 honey this is a natural phenomenon . i mean it happens like once a year . it s a great opportunity .
Ses05F_script02_1_M019 think about people in kansas they have to get a a plane reservation and a hotel reservation just to see this uh but we are just forty minutes away . too good to pass up .
Ses05F_script02_1_M020 yeah but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives all that flopping around is laying eggs or what you mating or spawning or something like that .
Ses05F_script02_1_M021 this is a big night for these guys . life s last orgy . yeah
Ses05F_script02_1_M022 yeah they do .
Ses05F_script02_1_M023 okay but they are fish that do something that no other fish do . like the swallows returning to capistrano or the lemmings jumping off a cliff you know like that .
Ses05F_script02_1_M024 there s there s mystery here and magic . a little bit of the unexplainable . i can t understand how you could not be interested .
Ses05F_script02_1_M025 for real ?
Ses05F_script02_1_M026 i don t get it the first time we came out here you said it was the best night of your life and last year i remember distinctly you were so excited that you stuff your toe pushing me out of the door and you didn t notice it until you got into the car .
Ses05F_script02_1_M027 we weren t in a good spot .
Ses05F_script02_1_M028 we just weren t in a good spot . this is a much better spot . i got a great instinct for these things .
Ses05F_script02_1_M029 look there what s that ? is it ? is that a ah it s a seaweed isn t it ?
Ses05F_script02_1_M030 oh this is great . i wouldn t miss this for the world . i mean think about this . i know you are not interested but think about this for a second .
Ses05F_script02_1_M031 somewhere out there is a giant mass of silver fish all swimming in this direction . they don t know why and we don t know why . they didn t get an invitation . and it wasn t a vote it wasn t a decision . and nobody sent them a map or anything like that .
Ses05F_script02_1_M032 it s just some little instinctual time release firecracker that went off inside them and all this one they turn around and form a line as long as the california coast and just started swimming .
Ses05F_script02_1_M033 they are swimming right now as if it s the only thing that matters . it s it s single mindedness with no mind urgency that s pure urge . it s they don t know what drives them . they they don t give any name or ask any question . they just turn as one and started to swim to the very point we are standing right now for a massive celebration of sex and death . god it s giving me goose bumps all over my hairs on my arm . popping up .
Ses05F_script02_1_M034 well so what do you think ?
Ses05M_impro07_F000 what ?

Ses05F_script01_1_F000 what s he going to say ? maybe we should tell him before he sees it .
Ses05F_script01_1_F001 how could he see it ? i was the first one up . he was still in bed .
Ses05F_script01_1_F002 when ?
Ses05F_script01_1_F003 what was he doing out here at four in the morning ?
Ses05F_script01_1_F004 did you talk to him ?
Ses05F_script01_1_F005 he cried hard .
Ses05F_script01_1_F006 he is thinking about him again .
Ses05F_script01_1_F007 it s getting just like after larry died he s having dreams he s walking around at night .
Ses05F_script01_1_F008 what s the meaning of that ?
Ses05F_script01_1_F009 what ?
Ses05F_script01_1_F010 what do you mean dishonest ?
Ses05F_script01_1_F011 what are you going to do argue with him ?
Ses05F_script01_1_F012 you can t just say that to him .
Ses05F_script01_1_F013 how are you going to prove it i mean there s no body and there s no grave . so what are you going to do ? do you have proof ?
Ses05F_script01_1_F014 to you it is and to me but not to your father . now look you can talk yourself blue in the face but there s no body and there s no grave so where are you ?
Ses05F_script01_1_F015 the trouble with the god damned newspapers i mean every week they do a story about some boy s been gone longer than larry and he comes back so the next one is gonna 
Ses05F_script01_1_F016 why ?
Ses05F_script01_1_F017 well i got an idea . but what s the story ?
Ses05F_script01_1_F018 well that s nobody s business but yours chris .
Ses05F_script01_1_F019 what what am what are you going to do i mean you re old enough to make up your own mind ?
Ses05F_script01_1_F020 well you re want to make sure your father isn t you know going to lose them
Ses05F_script01_1_F021 i ignore what i got to ignore . the girl is larry s girl .
Ses05F_script01_1_F022 as far as your father is concerned he s not dead and you ve no right to take his girl .
Ses05F_script01_1_F023 now chris you can go on from there but i don t know what to do . i mean do you know what to do because i don t .
Ses05F_script01_1_F024 well you re a considerate fellow there s nothing wrong with that .
Ses05F_script01_1_F025 have you asked annie yet to marry you ?
Ses05F_script01_1_F026 well how did you know that she will go along with it i mean maybe she feels the same way as your father ?
Ses05F_script01_1_F027 the trouble is you don t see enough women you never have
Ses05F_script01_1_F028 well i just don t see why it has to be annie .
Ses05F_script01_1_F029 well that s a good reason but it doesn t answer a thing .
Ses05F_script01_1_F030 no i don t want a diagram but chris your father thinks larry s coming back .
Ses05F_script01_1_F031 you marry his girl and you re pronouncing him dead . now what s going to happen to your father do you know ? i don t .
Ses05F_script01_1_F032 give it some more thought .
Ses05F_script01_1_F033 what the hell is this ?
Ses05F_script01_1_F034 are you crazy ?
Ses05F_script01_1_F035 wait a minute . tell me this . do you mean to say that you would leave the business ?
Ses05F_script01_1_F036 must you be inspired ?
Ses05F_script01_1_F037 don t you you can t think like that ! don t think like that !
Ses05F_script01_1_F038 all right ! but don t think like that because i mean what the hell did we do all this for chris ? the whole business it s all for you ! the whole shooting match is for you !
Ses05F_script01_1_F039 all right but don t think like that .
Ses05F_script01_1_F040 i don t understand you do i ?
Ses05F_script01_1_F041 yeah i can see that .
Ses05F_script01_1_M000 he saw it .
Ses05F_script01_1_M001 he was out here when it broke .
Ses05F_script01_1_M002 around four this morning and there was a crack and i looked out . we re standing right there when i cracked .
Ses05F_script01_1_M003 i don t know . but when it cracked he ran back into the house and start to cry in the kitchen .
Ses05F_script01_1_M004 no . i figured it was best to leave him alone .
Ses05F_script01_1_M005 i could hear him right through the floor of my room .
Ses05F_script01_1_M006 i guess he is .
Ses05F_script01_1_M007 i don t know the meaning of it . but i know one thing mom did . we made a terrible mistake with dad .
Ses05F_script01_1_M008 being dishonest with him . it s the kind of thing that pays off and now it s paying off .
Ses05F_script01_1_M009 you know that larry s not coming back and i know it . so why do we go on letting him think that we believe with him ?
Ses05F_script01_1_M010 no um i don t want to argue with him but it s time we realized that nobody else believes that larry is alive .
Ses05F_script01_1_M011 why shouldn t he dream about him walk around during the night looking for him um . do we contradict him ? do we say outright that we don t have any hope anymore that we haven t had any for years now ?
Ses05F_script01_1_M012 we have to say it to him !
Ses05F_script01_1_M013 for god s sake mom three years . nobody comes back after three years ! it s insane !
Ses05F_script01_1_M014 sit down mom . i want to talk to you .
Ses05F_script01_1_M015 all right all right mom . listen !
Ses05F_script01_1_M016 you know why i asked annie here don t you ?
Ses05F_script01_1_M017 you know .
Ses05F_script01_1_M018 i m going to ask her to marry me .
Ses05F_script01_1_M019 you know that s not just my business .
Ses05F_script01_1_M020 so it s all right . i can go ahead with it then ?
Ses05F_script01_1_M021 then it s not only my business . sometimes you infuriate me . you know that ?
Ses05F_script01_1_M022 you know that ? isn t it your business too if i tell dad and he gets throws a fit about it ? you have such a talent for ignoring things !
Ses05F_script01_1_M023 she s not larry s girl !
Ses05F_script01_1_M024 i don t know why it is . but every time i reach out for something i want i have to pull back because other people will suffer . my whole bloody life time after time after time .
Ses05F_script01_1_M025 to hell with that !
Ses05F_script01_1_M026 i want to get this settled first .
Ses05F_script01_1_M027 well if she does then that s the end of it but from her letters it sounds like she s forgotten about it . i ll find out and then we ll thrash it out with dad all right ? mom don t avoid me .
Ses05F_script01_1_M028 so what i m not fast with women .
Ses05F_script01_1_M029 because it is .
Ses05F_script01_1_M030 i can t help it . i know her best . i was brought up next door to here the easiest when i think of somebody for my wife i think of annie . do you want a diagram ?
Ses05F_script01_1_M031 all right then mom .

Ses05F_script03_1_F029 that was the first time you ever hit me .
Ses05F_script03_1_F030 and then the manager came in and found us rolling around on the floor biting and scratching like panthers .
Ses05F_script03_1_F031 oh ridiculous . utterly ridiculous
Ses05F_script03_1_F032 and very much sillier .

Ses05F_script03_1_M013 all the futile mortals who try to make life unbearable . laugh at them . be flippant . laugh at everything all their sacred shibboleths . flippancy brings out the acid in their damned sweetness and light .
Ses05F_script03_1_M014 certainly you must . we re figures of fun alright laughter .
Ses05F_script03_1_M015 who knows ?
Ses05F_script03_1_M016 no that fire will fade along with our passion .
Ses05F_script03_1_M017 it all depends on how well we played .
Ses05F_script03_1_M018 yes yes with all his might .
Ses05F_script03_1_M019 no no it isn t . death is very laughable . come such a cunning little mystery all done with mirrors .

Ses05F_script03_1_M021 enjoy the party as long as we can like very little quite idiotic schoolchildren . garbage let s savor the delight of the moment .
Ses05F_script03_1_M022 darling come here and kiss me before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets .

Ses05F_script03_1_M026 horrible thing i hate it .
Ses05F_script03_1_M027 how long did that row last ?
Ses05F_script03_1_M028 the worst one was in cannes when your curling irons burnt a hole in my new dressing gown .

Ses05F_script03_1_M030 oh i didn t hit you very hard .

Ses05F_script03_1_M032 oh we were very much younger then .
Ses05F_script03_1_M033 oh as a matter of fact the real cause of that row was peter burden .
Ses05F_script03_2_F000 you knew there was nothing in that .
Ses05F_script03_2_F001 only a trivial little broach .
Ses05F_script03_2_F002 no not at all . i i still have it . i wear it quite often .
Ses05F_script03_2_F003 you worked the whole thing up in your jealous imagination .

Ses05F_script03_2_F005 and what of it ?
Ses05F_script03_2_F006 well i he got a lot of pleasure out of it and it didn t hurt me .
Ses05F_script03_2_F007 well if you hadn t been so nosey and suspicious you never would have heard about it .
Ses05F_script03_2_F008 i m growing quite tired and bored of this conversation .

Ses05F_script03_2_F010 i don t see why you want any . you ve already had three glasses .
Ses05F_script03_2_F011 well it seems silly to go on and on in such a thing .

Ses05F_script03_2_F013 don t be so stupid .
Ses05F_script03_2_F014 just making myself fascinating for you .
Ses05F_script03_2_F015 it s the woman s job to allure the man . why don t you watch me for a moment ?

Ses05F_script03_2_F021 i don t care if they bark and roll around like hoops okay .
Ses05F_script03_2_F022 yes i did quite a bit .
Ses05F_script03_2_F023 mind your own business .
Ses05F_script03_2_F024 oh dear you really are becoming quite insufferable . i would imagine it s because you re drunk .
Ses05F_script03_2_F025 oh no on the contrary a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass .
Ses05F_script03_2_F026 oh you are so insufferable . do you stop .
Ses05F_script03_2_F027 not very funny dear you better have some more brandy .

Ses05F_script03_2_F040 oh marry you again ? i must have been insane . what was i thinking ? i mean you re completely outrageous .
Ses05F_script03_2_F041 beast brute cad whore
Ses05F_script03_2_M000 as a matter of fact the real cause of that row was peter burden .
Ses05F_script03_2_M001 i knew nothing of the sort . you accepted presents from him .
Ses05F_script03_2_M002 i remember it well covered in diamonds in the worst possible taste .
Ses05F_script03_2_M003 you went out of your way to torture me over peter burden .
Ses05F_script03_2_M004 you must admit that he was in love with you wasn t he ?
Ses05F_script03_2_M005 you let him kiss you . you said you did .
Ses05F_script03_2_M006 what of it ?
Ses05F_script03_2_M007 what about me ?
Ses05F_script03_2_M008 well that s a nice point of view i must say .
Ses05F_script03_2_M009 so am i bored stiff . would you like some brandy ?
Ses05F_script03_2_M010 i ll have a little i think .
Ses05F_script03_2_M011 no particular reason besides they were very small ones .
Ses05F_script03_2_M012 you can hardly call three liqueur glasses of brandy in a whole evening going on and on .
Ses05F_script03_2_M013 you needn t be so grand simply because you don t happen to want any at the moment .
Ses05F_script03_2_M014 really amanda .
Ses05F_script03_2_M015 going out somewhere dear ?
Ses05F_script03_2_M016 oh that reply has broken my heart .
Ses05F_script03_2_M017 as a matter of fact that is perfectly true .
Ses05F_script03_2_M018 oh yes it is .
Ses05F_script03_2_M019 it s a pity you didn t take a little more brandy . it might have made you a little less disagreeable .
Ses05F_script03_2_M020 well snap snap snap like a little adder .
Ses05F_script03_2_M021 nonsense they have a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap .
Ses05F_script03_2_M022 they snap .
Ses05F_script03_2_M023  breathing 
Ses05F_script03_2_M024 did you see much of peter burden after the divorce ?
Ses05F_script03_2_M025 i suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more then .
Ses05F_script03_2_M026 you must have a riotous time no restraint at all very enjoyable . i mean you never had much anyway .
Ses05F_script03_2_M027 i m not the least bit drunk .
Ses05F_script03_2_M028 i think i mentioned once before that i had only three minute liqueur glasses of brandy the entire evening long . a child of two could not be drunk on that .
Ses05F_script03_2_M029 oh very interesting . how about a child of three or a child of six ? how about a child of nine ?
Ses05F_script03_2_M030 oh this is very interesting . we we might get a splendid debate going about this intemperate tots .
Ses05F_script03_2_M031 oh very good idea . i will .
Ses05F_script03_2_M032 you better turn that off i think .
Ses05F_script03_2_M033 it s very late and it will disturb the people upstairs .
Ses05F_script03_2_M034 well there are people downstairs i suppose .
Ses05F_script03_2_M035 it is not time of year for tunis .
Ses05F_script03_2_M036 i ll do no such thing .

Ses05F_script03_2_M041 very music amusing indeed .
Ses05F_script03_2_M042 you are a vile tempered loose living wicked little beast and i never want to set eyes on you again .
Ses05F_script03_2_M043 shut up shut up . i wouldn t marry you again if you came crawling to me on bended knee . you re a mean evil minded little vampire and i hope to god i never set eyes on you again .

Ses05M_script02_1_F012 it s stupid .
Ses05M_script02_1_F013 pass what up ? it s it s just little fish and they swim up on the beach and they flop around and they swim away and then they die .
Ses05M_script02_1_F014 what are you so excited about . this isn t rocket science this is just fish . fish nobody even eats .
Ses05M_script02_1_F015 augie .
Ses05M_script02_1_F016 i m just not .
Ses05M_script02_1_F017 yes .
Ses05M_script02_1_F018 well if you also remember last year we our shoes got wet i got sand in my panties we had a big argument you had a sore throat and we didn t see the grunion .
Ses05M_script02_1_F019 we didn t see them the first time either .
Ses05M_script02_1_F020 that s the wind .
Ses05M_script02_1_M000 what time is it ? they re supposed to run around midnight . oh this is great isn t it ? look at the night we ve got here . it couldn t be better . actually i wanted to go a little further up the coast you know to get away from all the lights and the people . i was afraid we might miss it though so how are you doing ?
Ses05M_script02_1_M001 what s that ? is that wait is that foam ? i can t even tell . oh actually i guess if i can t tell then it probably isn t it is it ? it will probably be unmistakable don t you think ?
Ses05M_script02_1_M002 this is great . how are you doing ? oh no . oh do you know what i did ? i forgot the flashlight . how could i be so stupid ? i forgot the flashlight .
Ses05M_script02_1_M003 the flashlight . the silver one . there s only one isn t there ? stupid .
Ses05M_script02_1_M004 well 
Ses05M_script02_1_M005 oh no of course our flashlight . me flashlight is to you flashlight naturally .
Ses05M_script02_1_M006 how could we have forgotten it ? well i hope the moon stays out . i wonder do they always run during a full moon ? i can t remember was the moon full last year do you remember ?
Ses05M_script02_1_M007 are you cold ? do you want my jacket ? we should have brought the blanket our blanket . oh this is great . i didn t even think to bring a six pack . oh a six pack would be just the ticket right about now .
Ses05M_script02_1_M008 i can t believe i forgot .i m like a little kid . i m surprised i made it out of the house with my fly zipped . oh laughter 
Ses05M_script02_1_M009 oh i wonder if they can hear me or if they can feel the vibrations when we move around in the sand . or something
Ses05M_script02_1_M010 do you want my jacket ?
Ses05M_script02_1_M011 are you kidding ? we just got here we d miss it . what s the point of coming all the way out here if we re just going to turn around and go home ?
Ses05M_script02_1_M012 right .
Ses05M_script02_1_M013 that s my point too .
Ses05M_script02_1_M014 oh no no no . no that s not my point . my point is what s the point coming out here if we re just going to leave ? don t you want to see it ?
Ses05M_script02_1_M015 why not ?
Ses05M_script02_1_M016 oh
Ses05M_script02_1_M017 honey it s a natural phenomenon . i mean this kind of thing only happens once a year . it s a great opportunity .
Ses05M_script02_1_M018 i mean think about people in kansas they ve got to get like you know plane tickets and hotel reservations just to see this . we re just forty minutes away . it s just too good of an opportunity to pass up .
Ses05M_script02_1_M019 yeah but all that time on the beach is the highlight of their little lives . you know 
Ses05M_script02_1_M020 and all that about flopping around it s like laying eggs or what do you spawning or mating or something like that .
Ses05M_script02_1_M021 i mean this is a big night for these guys . you know life s last orgy .
Ses05M_script02_1_M022 yeah they do .
Ses05M_script02_1_M023 all right . but they are fish that do something no other fish do . like the swallows were turning into capistrano or lemmings jumping off the cliffs you know like that . there s there s magic here and mystery . and a little bit of the unexplainable . you know i can t see how you could not be interested .
Ses05M_script02_1_M024 for real ?
Ses05M_script02_1_M025 i don t get it . i mean the first time we came you said it was the best night of your life . and last year i remember distinctly you were so excited about coming that you stubbed your toe toe pushing me out the door and you didn t even notice until you got in the car .
Ses05M_script02_1_M026 we weren t in a good spot .
Ses05M_script02_1_M027 we just weren t in a good spot . this is a much better spot . i ve got a great sense for these things .
Ses05M_script02_1_M028 look there . what is that ? is that oh no that s seaweed .
Ses05M_script02_1_M029 oh this is great . i wouldn t miss this for the world . i mean think about this i know you re not interested but just think about this for a second 
Ses05M_script02_1_M030 somewhere out there is a giant mass of silver fish all swimming in this direction . they don t know why they re doing it . we don t know why they re doing it . they didn t it wasn t a decision . no one took a vote . nobody sent them an invitation or a map or anything like that . it was just some internal time release fire cracker that went off . and all as one they turned around and formed this giant line as long as the california coastline and they just started swimming . they are swimming right now at this very moment . and and 
Ses05M_script02_1_M031 and it s single mindedness with no mind . it it s urgency it s pure urge . i mean they didn t make any decisions . they don t ask any questions . they don t give it a name 
Ses05M_script02_1_M032 they just all as one turn around and start swimming to this very point where we are standing now for one last celebration of sex and death . god it s giving me goosebumps . look at all the hairs that are standing up .
Ses05M_script02_1_M033 well so what do you think ?

Ses05F_impro04_M043 you know i ll always help you .
Ses05M_script01_1_F000 what s he going to say ? maybe we should tell him before he sees it .
Ses05M_script01_1_F001 when ? i was the first one up . he was still in bed . how could he have seen it ?
Ses05M_script01_1_F002 when ?
Ses05M_script01_1_F003 what was he doing out here at four in the morning ?
Ses05M_script01_1_F004 did you talk to him ?
Ses05M_script01_1_F005 he cried hard ?
Ses05M_script01_1_F006 what was he doing out there at that hour ? he s getting just like after larry died walking around at night . he dreams .
Ses05M_script01_1_F007 what s the meaning of that ?
Ses05M_script01_1_F008 what ?
Ses05M_script01_1_F009 what do you mean dishonest ?
Ses05M_script01_1_F010 what do you want to do argue with him ?
Ses05M_script01_1_F011 you can t say that to him .
Ses05M_script01_1_F012 how are you gonna prove it ? can you prove it ?
Ses05M_script01_1_F013 to you it is and to me but not to him . now you can talk yourself until you re blue in the face chris but there s no body and there s no grave . so where are you ?
Ses05M_script01_1_F014 the trouble is the god damn newspapers . i mean every every week a kid turns up missing like longer than larry .
Ses05M_script01_1_F015 why ?
Ses05M_script01_1_F016 well i have an idea . but what s the story ?
Ses05M_script01_1_F017 well that s your business chris .
Ses05M_script01_1_F018 well what do you want me to do ? you re old enough to make to know your own mind .
Ses05M_script01_1_F019 well you want to make sure that your father isn t 
Ses05M_script01_1_F020 i m just saying .
Ses05M_script01_1_F021 i ignore what i got to ignore . i mean the girl is larry s girl .
Ses05M_script01_1_F022 from your father s point of view he s not dead and she s still his girl . now you can go on from there if you know where to go chris but i don t know . so what can i do for you ?
Ses05M_script01_1_F023 well you re a considerate fella there s nothing wrong in that
Ses05M_script01_1_F024 have you asked annie yet ?
Ses05M_script01_1_F025 well what if she feels like your father ? and how do you know she will marry you ?
Ses05M_script01_1_F026 well the trouble is you never saw enough women .
Ses05M_script01_1_F027 well i just don t see why it has to be annie .
Ses05M_script01_1_F028 well that s a good reason . but that doesn t mean anything at all . i mean you haven t seen her in five years .
Ses05M_script01_1_F029 no . i don t want a look your father thinks he s coming back chris . you marry that girl and you re pronouncing him dead . now what s going to happen to your father do you know ? because i don t .
Ses05M_script01_1_F030 just give it some more thought .
Ses05M_script01_1_F031 what the hell is this ?
Ses05M_script01_1_F032 are you crazy ?
Ses05M_script01_1_F033 what ? you mean ? tell me something you mean that you would leave the business ?
Ses05M_script01_1_F034 you can t think like that .
Ses05M_script01_1_F035 all right . but don t think like that . because what the hell did we work for chris ? i mean this whole thing it s all for you .
Ses05M_script01_1_F036 just don t think that way . do you hear me ?
Ses05M_script01_1_F037 i don t understand you do i ?
Ses05M_script01_1_F038 yeah i can see that .
Ses05M_script01_1_M000 he saw it .
Ses05M_script01_1_M001 he was out here when it broke .
Ses05M_script01_1_M002 i don t know like four o clock this morning . i heard a crack and i woke up and i looked out the window and he was standing right there when it broke .
Ses05M_script01_1_M003 i don t know but after it broke he ran back inside and started crying in the kitchen .
Ses05M_script01_1_M004 no . i figured it was best to leave him alone .
Ses05M_script01_1_M005 i could hear him right through the floor in my room .
Ses05M_script01_1_M006 i guess he is .
Ses05M_script01_1_M007 i don t know the meaning of it but you know one thing mom we made a terrible mistake with dad .
Ses05M_script01_1_M008 being dishonest with him . it s the kind of thing that pays off and now it s paying off .
Ses05M_script01_1_M009 you know that larry s not coming back and i know it . so why do we go on letting him think that we believe with him ?
Ses05M_script01_1_M010 i don t want to argue with him . but it s time he knows that nobody else thinks that larry s alive anymore .
Ses05M_script01_1_M011 why should he dream about him walking around looking for him at night ? do we contradict him ? do we say straight out that we don t have any hope anymore that we haven t had any hope for years now ?
Ses05M_script01_1_M012 we have to say it to him .
Ses05M_script01_1_M013 for gods sake ! three years ! nobody comes back after three years . that s insane !
Ses05M_script01_1_M014 sit down mom . i want to talk to you .
Ses05M_script01_1_M015 all right . all right mom . just listen . you know why i invited annie her don t you ?
Ses05M_script01_1_M016 you know .
Ses05M_script01_1_M017 i m going to ask her to marry me .
Ses05M_script01_1_M018 it s not just my business .
Ses05M_script01_1_M019 so it s okay then ? i should just go ahead and do it ?
Ses05M_script01_1_M020 oh so it isn t just my business ?
Ses05M_script01_1_M021 you infuriate me sometimes . do you know that ? god .
Ses05M_script01_1_M022 isn t it your business too if dad if i tell dad and he throws a fit about it ? i mean you have such a talent for ignoring things .
Ses05M_script01_1_M023 she is not larry s girl !
Ses05M_script01_1_M024 i don t know why it is but everytime i reach out for something i that i want i have to pull back because i might hurt somebody else . my whole bloody life time after time after time .
Ses05M_script01_1_M025 to hell with that !
Ses05M_script01_1_M026 i wanted to get this taken care of first .
Ses05M_script01_1_M027 well if that s the case then that s the end of it . but from her letters it sounds like she has forgotten him . i ll find out . and then we ll thrash it out with dad all right ? mom don t avoid me .
Ses05M_script01_1_M028 so what ? i m not fast with women .
Ses05M_script01_1_M029 because it is .
Ses05M_script01_1_M030 i know her best all right ? i don t know . i grew up next to her . when i think of somebody for my wife these days i think of annie . what do you want a diagram ?
Ses05M_script01_1_M031 all right then mom .
Ses05M_script01_1_M032 i ve given it three years of thought . i hoped that if i d waited dad would have forgotten about it by now . and we could have like a normal wedding and everybody happy .
Ses05M_script01_1_M033 but if that can t happen i ll just have to get out .
Ses05M_script01_1_M034 i ll get out . i ll go get married and live someplace else . i don t know maybe new york .
Ses05M_script01_1_M035 i have been a good son for too long . a good sucker . i m through with it .
Ses05M_script01_1_M036 yes . on this i would .
Ses05M_script01_1_M037 well you help me stay here .
Ses05M_script01_1_M038 i know that mom . just you help me stay here .
Ses05M_script01_1_M039 i am thinking that way .
Ses05M_script01_1_M040 no you don t . i m a pretty tough guy .

Ses05M_impro05_F007 yeah .
Ses05M_impro05_F008 okay .
Ses05M_impro05_F009 did you have insurance on your flight ?

Ses05M_impro05_F011 well it s something that worth
Ses05M_impro05_F012 yeah i don t know .
Ses05M_impro05_F013 chances are it s probably just you know taking time being um unloaded from the airplane .
Ses05M_impro05_F014 um well there s not much i can do . i can you can file this report and we ll call you when it comes in .
Ses05M_impro05_F015 wow .
Ses05M_impro05_F016 wow . well that s really important obviously . but um 
Ses05M_impro05_F017 uh actually i don t know that that s legal . um it is the issue
Ses05M_impro05_F018 yeah i mean your bag might have been confiscated because it s 
Ses05M_impro05_F019  it s a biohazard . so um

Ses05M_impro05_M010 i mean it s not big or anything like that . i mean it s not worth a lot of money or anything .
Ses05M_impro05_M011 no . i mean don t you get insurance when you buy your ticket or something ?
Ses05M_impro05_M012 well no one even told me about that . like why would i think to buy insurance ? i was it s like a three hour flight .

Ses05M_impro05_M022 thank you
Ses05F_script02_2_F000 about what ?
Ses05F_script02_2_F001 it s ridiculous .
Ses05F_script02_2_F002 it s pr somebody sold you a bill of goods that this wonderful event is going to occur on the beach .
Ses05F_script02_2_F003 yeah they are all told the same thing . they are all told that you know . gets them excited and they can t wait and that if they just get in on the right spot than you than maybe life will start
Ses05F_script02_2_F004 i am sorry . it s just fish to me .
Ses05F_script02_2_F005 god damn it augie . why do you always ask things like that ? it s so insulting .
Ses05F_script02_2_F006 i just had a different idea of what this evening is going to look like .
Ses05F_script02_2_F007 for heaven s sake augie grow up we are not going to see the grunions .
Ses05F_script02_2_F008 we never do . have we ever ? we never have .
Ses05F_script02_2_F009 twice is every time we tried that s ever .
Ses05F_script02_2_F010 no we won t . augie it s like waiting for santa claus to come . i feel like i am going to spend my entire life standing on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasp expectantly in front of me waiting for the fish to show up and the fish will not show up .
Ses05F_script02_2_F011 i did i do want to see it . i always want to see it augie .
Ses05F_script02_2_F012 for heaven s sake this is not about fish .
Ses05F_script02_2_F013 augie do you remember the first time we came to see it ? it was about four years ago right after we got married and we thought i was pregnant .
Ses05F_script02_2_F014 we had a bottle of champagne but no glasses and you ask me to dance so we took off our shoes and while we were dancing you said the most intimate things right in my ears so i could feel them as much as hear them .
Ses05F_script02_2_F015 and i remember thinking finally finally . i am as happy as i am supposed to be .
Ses05F_script02_2_F016 dancing barefoot in the sand drinking champagne from the bottle .
Ses05F_script02_2_F017 i rather not remember some things . i rather not hope for some things .
Ses05F_script02_2_F018 no .
Ses05F_script02_2_F019 no .
Ses05F_script02_2_F020 no .
Ses05F_script02_2_F021 no .
Ses05F_script02_2_F022 no .
Ses05F_script02_2_F023 no no .
Ses05F_script02_2_F024 i want something to turn out the way it is suppose to turn out .
Ses05F_script02_2_F025 this what ? what is this ? this isn t even anything .
Ses05F_script02_2_F026 sure this is standing . this is waiting . this is fighting .
Ses05F_script02_2_F027 but this isn t anything like i thought it would be .
Ses05F_script02_2_F028 i mean it is just this i mean it includes a lot and everything and you know it s the sand and it s the full moon and i just i am sorry but i couldn t help wishing i was somewhere else .
Ses05F_script02_2_F029 i didn t say that .
Ses05F_script02_2_F030 for heaven s sake augie wherever i am i always wanted to be with you .
Ses05F_script02_2_F031 for heaven s sake don t you know that ?
Ses05F_script02_2_F032 whatever i am doing i wanted to be with you . i mean you are probably the one who wishes you were with somebody else somebody who didn t take everything so hard and who knows how to enjoy herself .
Ses05F_script02_2_F033 good . so maybe we are on the wrong spot but we are with the right person .
Ses05F_script02_2_F034 yes i did notice that . it does look really beautiful on the water . the gold white moon .
Ses05F_script02_2_F035 augie you bought refreshments .
Ses05F_script02_2_F036 well than we don t need glasses .
Ses05F_script02_2_F037 no i am beginning to think that maybe this is the spot after all .
Ses05F_script02_2_F038 or not .
Ses05F_script02_2_M000 well so ? what do you think ?
Ses05F_script02_2_M001 what i was just saying .
Ses05F_script02_2_M002 it certainly is not . it s slightly exaggerated scientific fact .
Ses05F_script02_2_M003 i am not the only one look at all these people .
Ses05F_script02_2_M004 are we talking about the same thing ?
Ses05F_script02_2_M005 carla can i ask you a question ? now don t be upset are you having a period ?
Ses05F_script02_2_M006 what s bugging you ?
Ses05F_script02_2_M007 there s nothing to it . we come down here . the grunion arrives and they do their little fish thing . and we say oh wow . look at the little fish . they go home we go home .
Ses05F_script02_2_M008 why not ?
Ses05F_script02_2_M009 we miss them twice it s not ever .
Ses05F_script02_2_M010 well we will see them this year .
Ses05F_script02_2_M011 i thought you wanted to see it .
Ses05F_script02_2_M012 it s just fish it s nothing to get traumatize over .
Ses05F_script02_2_M013 okay i been trying to work this backwards but i can t seem to pinpoint a moment when we took a turn for the worst here .
Ses05F_script02_2_M014 when you are on the phone with marge everything was fine . dinner was okay . doing the dishes was no problem . let s see i took a shower and you were watching the news and you said the grunions are running tonight and i said great let s go i am feeling lucky .
Ses05F_script02_2_M015 right so i am putting on my jacket and putting up the animals and pulling the car out of the garage .
Ses05F_script02_2_M016 wait a minute i got it .
Ses05F_script02_2_M017 it was in the car right ? when we were passing knickerbocker liquor locker you said let s get some champagne . and i said time wasting or something like that . right ? of course .
Ses05F_script02_2_M018 okay all right i got it . you wanted it to be like the other time okay no problem . listen you want to dance ?
Ses05F_script02_2_M019 you want me to go get some champagne ?
Ses05F_script02_2_M020 take off our shoes ?
Ses05F_script02_2_M021 what you want me to whisper in your ear ?

Ses05F_script02_2_M025 what . welcome to the human race .
Ses05F_script02_2_M026 you think this is what i had in mind ? you think that when i propose i had this great fantasy going that four years down the road we will end up on a beach arguing over fish . you think that i knew that there would be times when you will look at me like i am used kleenex ? or that i will look at you and think holy hell what s the next flight to alaska .
Ses05F_script02_2_M027 no no i was just like you i thought it will be all peaches and roses and and sand in our toes and wind in our hair and the fish will always come . and the bills will always magically pay themselves and we will have three fat rosy kids and we will be haha baby the joke is on us .
Ses05F_script02_2_M028 because you know what carla ? you know what you get ? this .
Ses05F_script02_2_M029 yes it is .

Ses05M_impro04_M041 i ll need it .
Ses05F_impro05_F000 hi um i think my baggage was lost and i need to i guess file a claim or i don t know what .
Ses05F_impro05_F001 um seventeen . coming from 
Ses05F_impro05_F002 it was virgin atlantic coming from london .
Ses05F_impro05_F003 yeah i don t know where it was lost . i was coming from africa so .
Ses05F_impro05_F004 right .
Ses05F_impro05_F005 yeah .
Ses05F_impro05_F006 that s good .
Ses05F_impro05_F007 well i can t leave without it . i mean could you find out ?
Ses05F_impro05_F008 right well can you get on the computer maybe and like track it down and see when it s going to get here ?
Ses05F_impro05_F009 yes sir i know what my bag looks like .
Ses05F_impro05_F010 um it s a travel backpack . it s green and gray . it s got my name on it and my information .
Ses05F_impro05_F011 no it didn t turn up at the baggage claim .
Ses05F_impro05_F012 i mean we ve gone through all of this . i ve been to five people already who 
Ses05F_impro05_F013 okay .
Ses05F_impro05_F014 yes lots of really like sentimental value only but 
Ses05F_impro05_F015  really important stuff .
Ses05F_impro05_F016 that s not going to cut it . like really i really need to get this bag back .
Ses05F_impro05_F017 does this happen often ? do they you just lose baggage and you just offer people money for it ?
Ses05F_impro05_F018 uh not lose the baggage in the first place . i mean you re offering a service here . i paid so much money for that ticket .
Ses05F_impro05_F019 no but i mean like why can t why can t you find it ? where did it go ? who lost it ?
Ses05F_impro05_F020 well i just i paid so much money for this ticket . i feel like you guys should be able to get to offer me more than a fifty dollar voucher .
Ses05F_impro05_F021 yeah meaning i didn t die in a fiery plane crash . how convenient but um i paid two thousand dollar to ride your airline and i would really appreciate getting my bags there to my destination in one place .
Ses05F_impro05_F022 right but part of the agreement is that i m paying so that i can take myself and my belongings with me .
Ses05F_impro05_F023 and that you re going to transport them safely from one place to another .
Ses05F_impro05_F024 that s all you can offer me ? i mean my the stuff in there is worth way more than fifty dollar .
Ses05F_impro05_F025 no .
Ses05F_impro05_F026 why do i need flight insurance ? why don t you guys just guarantee that you re going to get the stuff that i leave with to my destination ?
Ses05F_impro05_F027 right but if i m riding a bus i don t need to buy luggage insurance that the backpack i take on is going to get to my destination with me .
Ses05F_impro05_F028 because they made me check it . it s too heavy .
Ses05F_impro05_F029 so i would have carried it on but they made me check it and then they lost it .
Ses05F_impro05_F030 there s nothing else you can do ?
Ses05F_impro05_F031 i don t believe that for a second .
Ses05F_impro05_F032 no i don t think you are . i mean if you were doing everything you could you d either give me more money or you d figure out where my bag is .
Ses05F_impro05_F033 what do you mean as you can ? who makes up these rules ?
Ses05F_impro05_F034 you re an autono autonomous human being . you could you could go into the com 
Ses05F_impro05_F035 you could go into the computer and you know print 
Ses05F_impro05_F036 so i m just supposed to oh well oops my luggage is gone and be fine with that and take your stinking fifty dollar voucher ?
Ses05F_impro05_F037 and you have no guarantee .
Ses05F_impro05_F038 this is ridiculous .
Ses05F_impro05_F039 uh because you guys lost it so it should be your responsibility to find it too .
Ses05F_impro05_F040 oh come on . would you cut it out ? this is ridiculous .
Ses05F_impro05_F041 no i don t think i am . i like have a whole bunch of stuff that means a lot to me and i brought it you know from africa . it s not like i can just go back and get it whenever i want .
Ses05F_impro05_F042 it s not like i can go to kmart and buy another .
Ses05F_impro05_F043 okay fine .
Ses05F_impro05_F044 yeah i ll take your fifty dollar voucher .
Ses05F_impro05_F045 thanks .
Ses05F_impro05_M000 okay what flight were you on ?
Ses05F_impro05_M001 on what airline ?
Ses05F_impro05_M002 from london okay . um and you went through all your proper checkpoints ?
Ses05F_impro05_M003 so you haven t seen your bags since africa . you flew threw heath row to here .
Ses05F_impro05_M004 okay . well let me see here . i 
Ses05F_impro05_M005 it seems like it went through heath row . i see it here . uh 
Ses05F_impro05_M006 but uh i don t see it here in the airport yet . uh
Ses05F_impro05_M007 i m not sure where it is . we can absolutely keep an eye out for for it for you .
Ses05F_impro05_M008 well i m not a miracle worker . i don t know what i can do for you . i don t have the bag right here .
Ses05F_impro05_M009 well as i told you it left heath row and it seems to have arrived here . but if you can t find it then are you sure you know what your bag looks like ?
Ses05F_impro05_M010 okay and what is that ? what kind of bag is it ?
Ses05F_impro05_M011 and you couldn t find it ?
Ses05F_impro05_M012 are you sure ?
Ses05F_impro05_M013 well obviously that wasn t me so i m going to have to ask you the same questions they asked you just so we can get to the same point .
Ses05F_impro05_M014 all right ? now um it s green travel bag you couldn t find it . and was there something important in it that you need it ?
Ses05F_impro05_M015 sentimental value .
Ses05F_impro05_M016 right . well i don t know what to tell you . um what i can offer you is a fifty dollar voucher on your next flight .
Ses05F_impro05_M017 no i understand . i mean . it s got to be tough all those sentimental things but um this is all i can do for you .
Ses05F_impro05_M018 well you know sometimes that s really i mean what else could we do ?
Ses05F_impro05_M019 well 
Ses05F_impro05_M020 obviously ma am .
Ses05F_impro05_M021 i am sorry ma am .
Ses05F_impro05_M022 let s let s just relax for a moment ma am . you understand obviously we re going to do everything we can to keep all of your luggage here .
Ses05F_impro05_M023 obviously we re not trying to lose your luggage . do you really believe that we re trying to lose your luggage ma am ?
Ses05F_impro05_M024 well if i knew that then i d know where it was wouldn t i ?
Ses05F_impro05_M025 well we re talking about one bag . you personally made it here didn t you ?
Ses05F_impro05_M026 that s what the cost of the ticket was for .
Ses05F_impro05_M027 ma am international flights are not cheap and there s many reasons for that . it does not have solely to do with your baggage or 
Ses05F_impro05_M028 right . yes ma am .
Ses05F_impro05_M029 right and also if you ll read the fine print of your agreement you ll see that while we do bear some responsibility for lost luggage it is a fifty dollar voucher .
Ses05F_impro05_M030 well i understand that . did you buy flight insurance ?
Ses05F_impro05_M031 well my hands are really tied then .
Ses05F_impro05_M032 well it s like any kind of insurance . you don t when you get it then you get more . you know like if you 
Ses05F_impro05_M033 well of course not because you ve got your backpack with you the whole time . now if you you said this was a travel bag . why weren t you carrying it on if it was so important ?
Ses05F_impro05_M034 uh so it was really heavy .
Ses05F_impro05_M035 well you know what it could still turn up but until then i can offer you this fifty dollar voucher .
Ses05F_impro05_M036 i m sorry ma am there s nothing else i can do . my hands are really tied here . i really wish there was something else i could do for you .
Ses05F_impro05_M037 well i don t know why you wouldn t believe that .
Ses05F_impro05_M038 obviously i m doing everything that i can here .
Ses05F_impro05_M039 well i have no way to give you more money . i m giving you as much money as i can and figuring as far as figuring out where you bag is 
Ses05F_impro05_M040 makes up ?
Ses05F_impro05_M041 the airline makes these rules mom ma am .
Ses05F_impro05_M042 i ve gone into the computer . i told you exactly what i can see in the computer that your luggage did arrive here .
Ses05F_impro05_M043 well you can take my stinking fifty dollar voucher and go home and wait and see if your luggage turns up . and if it does then we ll deliver it to you .
Ses05F_impro05_M044 i have no guarantee absolutely not .
Ses05F_impro05_M045 how can i guarantee finding your luggage when it s lost ?
Ses05F_impro05_M046 right well when you re at home and you lose something do you guarantee that you re going to find it later on ?
Ses05F_impro05_M047 well it sounds to me like you re being ridiculous
Ses05F_impro05_M048 right .
Ses05F_impro05_M049 i understand that ma am but things get lost . there s nothing i can do about that . things happen . accidents happen .
Ses05F_impro05_M050 and while i really would love to be able to hand you your bag right now obviously i can t do that .
Ses05F_impro05_M051 so you d like the fifty dollar voucher ?
Ses05F_impro05_M052 okay just fill out these three forms and um you ll we ll have that sent to you within the next three weeks and of course we ll definitely keep an eye out for your bag .
Ses05F_impro05_M053 you have a wonderful day .
