## Daily Task
- 1/17
  - Why multi Schedulers, optimizer?
  - Scaler?
  - Only 1 sample in each batch

- 1/18
  - speech_fold_length

- 1/22
  - Evaluate blizzard13 with IEMOCAP
  - training properly
    1. batch = 1?
    2. reporter have no prosody weighted => check
    3. modify 1 line emo_feats in dev and train
 
 - 1/23
    - Start evaluating blizzard2013(5000 sentences) and check pre_trained model
        - ?
    - Implement middle-level Espnet_emoTTS model with feats extract of
        - contrl tts 
        - contrl emotts
            - 
    
    - Training controllable emoTTS
    
    - Implement Experiment
        - When model == contrl_tts
           -
